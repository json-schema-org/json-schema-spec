			<t>
				JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json" for 
				describing the structure of JSON text. JSON Schemas are also written in JSON and includes facilities 
				for describing the structure of JSON in terms of
				allowable values, descriptions, and interpreting relations with other resources.
			</t>
			<t>
				This document is organized into several separate definitions. The first 
				definition is the core schema specification. This definition is primary 
				concerned with describing a JSON structure and specifying valid elements
				in the structure. The second definition is the Hyper Schema specification
				which is intended to define elements in a structure that can be interpreted as
				hyperlinks.
				Hyper Schema builds on JSON Schema to describe the hyperlink structure of 
				JSON values. This allows user agents to be able to successfully navigate
				documents containing JSON based on their schemas.
			</t>
			<t>
				Cumulatively JSON Schema acts as meta-JSON that can be used to define the 
				required type and constraints on JSON values, as well as define the meaning
				of the JSON values for the purpose of describing a resource and determining
				hyperlinks within the representation.

				</artwork>
				<postamble>
					This schema defines the properties of the instance, 
					the required properties (id, name, and price), as well as an optional
					property (tags). This also defines the link relations of the instance.
				</postamble>
			</figure>
			
			<section title="Design Considerations">
				<t>
					The JSON Schema media type does not attempt to dictate the structure of JSON
					values that contain data, but rather provides a separate format
					for flexibly communicating how a JSON value should be
					interpreted and validated, such that user agents can properly understand
					acceptable structures and extrapolate hyperlink information
					from the JSON. It is acknowledged that JSON values come
					in a variety of structures, and JSON is unique in that the structure
					of stored data structures often prescribes a non-ambiguous definite
					JSON representation. Attempting to force a specific structure is generally
					not viable, and therefore JSON Schema allows for a great flexibility
					in the structure of the JSON data that it describes.
				</t>
				<t>
					This specification is protocol agnostic.
					The underlying protocol (such as HTTP) should sufficiently define the
					semantics of the client-server interface, the retrieval of resource
					representations linked to by JSON representations, and modification of 
					those resources. The goal of this
					format is to sufficiently describe JSON structures such that one can
					utilize existing information available in existing JSON
					representations from a large variety of services that leverage a representational state transfer
					architecture using existing protocols.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section title="Schema/Instance Association">
			<t>
				JSON values are correlated to their schema by the "describedby"
				relation, where the schema is the target of the relation.
				JSON values MUST be of the "application/json" media type or
				any other subtype. Consequently, dictating how a JSON value should 
				specify the relation to the schema is beyond the normative scope
				of this document since this document specifically defines the JSON
				Schema media type, and no other. It is RECOMMNENDED that JSON values
				specify their schema so that user agents can interpret the instance
				and retain the self-descriptive	characteristics. This avoides the need for out-of-band information about
				instance data. Two approaches are recommended for declaring the
				relation to the schema that describes the meaning of a JSON instance's (or collection 
				of instances) structure. A MIME type parameter named
				"profile" or a relation of "describedby" (which could be specified by a Link header) may be used:
				
				<figure>
					<artwork>
<![CDATA[	
Content-Type: application/my-media-type+json;
              profile=http://example.com/my-hyper-schema
]]>
					</artwork>
				</figure>
				
				or if the content is being transferred by a protocol (such as HTTP) that
				provides headers, a Link header can be used:
				
				<figure>
					<artwork>
<![CDATA[
Link: <http://example.com/my-hyper-schema>; rel="describedby"
]]>
					</artwork>
				</figure>
				
				Instances MAY specify multiple schemas, to indicate all the schemas that 
				are applicable to the data, and the data SHOULD be valid by all the schemas. 
				The instance data MAY have multiple schemas 
				that it is described by (the instance data SHOULD be valid for those schemas). 
				Or if the document is a collection of instances, the collection MAY contain 
				instances from different schemas. The mechanism for referencing a schema is 
				determined by the media type of the instance (if it provides a method for 
				referencing schemas).
			</t>
			
			<section title="Self-Descriptive Schema">
				<t>
					JSON Schemas can themselves be described using JSON Schemas. 
					A self-describing JSON Schema for the core JSON Schema can
					be found at <eref target="http://json-schema.org/schema">http://json-schema.org/schema</eref> for the latest version or 
					<eref target="http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema">http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema</eref> for the draft-04 version. The hyper schema 
					self-description can be found at <eref target="http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema">http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema</eref> 
					or <eref target="http://json-schema.org/draft-04/hyper-schema">http://json-schema.org/draft-04/hyper-schema</eref>. All schemas
					used within a protocol with a media type specified SHOULD include a MIME parameter that refers to the self-descriptive
					hyper schema or another schema that extends this hyper schema:

		<section title="Core Schema Definition">
			<t>
				A JSON Schema is a JSON object that defines various attributes 
				(including usage and valid values) of a JSON value. JSON
				Schema has recursive capabilities; there are a number of elements
				in the structure that allow for nested JSON Schemas.

				on JSON data. Just as with JSON
				schema attributes, all the attributes in hyper schemas are optional.
				Therefore, an empty object is a valid (non-informative) schema, and
				essentially describes plain JSON (no constraints on the structures).
				Addition of attributes provides additive information for user agents.

				<t>
					The value of the links property MUST be an array, where each item

				<!-- TODO: Needs more clarification and examples -->
				
				<section title="Link Description Object">
					<t>
						A link description object is used to describe link relations. In 
						the context of a schema, it defines the link relations of the 
						instances of the schema, and can be parameterized by the instance
						values. The link description format can be used without JSON Schema, 
						and use of this format can
						be declared by referencing the normative link description
						schema as the the schema for the data structure that uses the 
						links. The URI of the normative link description schema is: 
						<eref target="http://json-schema.org/links">http://json-schema.org/links</eref> (latest version) or
						<eref target="http://json-schema.org/draft-04/links">http://json-schema.org/draft-04/links</eref> (draft-04 version).
					</t>
					
					<section title="href" anchor="href">
						<t>
							The value of the "href" link description property
							indicates the target URI of the related resource. The value
							of the instance property SHOULD be resolved as a URI-Reference per <xref target="RFC3986">RFC 3986</xref>
							and MAY be a relative URI. The base URI to be used for relative resolution
							SHOULD be the URI used to retrieve the instance object (not the schema)
							when used within a schema. Also, when links are used within a schema, the URI 
							SHOULD be parametrized by the property values of the instance 
							object, if property values exist for the corresponding variables
							in the template (otherwise they MAY be provided from alternate sources, like user input).
						</t>
						
						<t>
							Instance property values SHOULD be substituted into the URIs where
							matching braces ('{', '}') are found surrounding zero or more characters,
							creating an expanded URI. Instance property value substitutions are resolved
							by using the text between the braces to denote the property name
							from the instance to get the value to substitute. 
							
							<figure>
								<preamble>For example, if an href value is defined:</preamble>
								<artwork>
<![CDATA[
http://somesite.com/{id}
]]>
								</artwork>
								<postamble>Then it would be resolved by replace the value of the "id" property value from the instance object.</postamble>

								<preamble>If the value of the "id" property was "45", the expanded URI would be:</preamble>
								<artwork>
<![CDATA[
http://somesite.com/45
]]>
								</artwork>
							</figure>
							
							If matching braces are found with the string "@" (no quotes) between the braces, then the 
							actual instance value SHOULD be used to replace the braces, rather than a property value.
							This should only be used in situations where the instance is a scalar (string, 
							boolean, or number), and not for objects or arrays.
						</t>
					</section>
					
					<section title="rel">
						<t>
							The value of the "rel" property indicates the name of the 
							relation to the target resource. The relation to the target SHOULD be interpreted as specifically from the instance object that the schema (or sub-schema) applies to, not just the top level resource that contains the object within its hierarchy. If a resource JSON representation contains a sub object with a property interpreted as a link, that sub-object holds the relation with the target. A relation to target from the top level resource MUST be indicated with the schema describing the top level JSON representation.
						</t>
						
						<t>
							Relationship definitions SHOULD NOT be media type dependent, and users are encouraged to utilize existing accepted relation definitions, including those in existing relation registries (see <xref target="RFC4287">RFC 4287</xref>). However, we define these relations here for clarity of normative interpretation within the context of JSON hyper schema defined relations:
							
							<list style="hanging">
								<t hangText="self">
									If the relation value is "self", when this property is encountered in
									the instance object, the object represents a resource and the instance object is
									treated as a full representation of the target resource identified by
									the specified URI.
								</t>
								
								<t hangText="full">
									This indicates that the target of the link is the full representation for the instance object. The object that contains this link possibly may not be the full representation.
								</t>
								
								<t hangText="describedby">
									This indicates the target of the link is the schema for the instance object. This MAY be used to specifically denote the schemas of objects within a JSON object hierarchy, facilitating polymorphic type data structures.
								</t>
								
								<t hangText="root">
									This relation indicates that the target of the link
									SHOULD be treated as the root or the body of the representation for the
									purposes of user agent interaction or fragment resolution. All other
									properties of the instance objects can be regarded as meta-data
									descriptions for the data.
								</t>
							</list>
						</t>
						
						<t>
							The following relations are applicable for schemas (the schema as the "from" resource in the relation):

							<list style="hanging">
								<t hangText="instances">This indicates the target resource that represents collection of instances of a schema.</t>
								<t hangText="create">This indicates a target to use for creating new instances of a schema. This link definition SHOULD be a submission link with a non-safe method (like POST).</t>
