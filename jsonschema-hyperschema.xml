                JSON Hyper-Schema is a JSON Schema vocabulary for annotating JSON documents
                with hyperlinks and instructions for processing and
                manipulating remote JSON resources through hypermedia environments such as HTTP.
            </t>
            <t>
                The term JSON Hyper-Schema is used to refer to a JSON Schema that uses these
                keywords.  The term "hyper-schema" on its own refers to a JSON Hyper-Schema
                within the scope of this specification.

            <t>
                The primary mechanism introduced for specifying links is the Link Description
                Object (LDO), which is a serialization of the abstract link model
                defined in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis">RFC 5988bis, section 2</xref>.
                <cref>
                    This section references the work-in-progress RFC5988bis, with the expectation
                    that it will reach RFC before this specification does.

        <section title="Overview">
            <t>
                JSON Hyper-Schema makes it possible to build hypermedia systems from JSON
                documents by describing how to construct hyperlinks from instance data.
            </t>
            <t>
                The combination of a JSON instance document and a valid application/schema+json
                hyper-schema for that instance behaves as a single hypermedia representation.
                By allowing this separation, hyper-schema-based systems can gracefully support
                applications that expect plain JSON, while providing full hypermedia capabilities
                for hyper-schema-aware applications and user agents.
            </t>
            <t>
                Client-side user agents can detect the presence of hyper-schema by looking for
                the application/schema+json media type and a "$schema" value that indicates the
                presence of the hyper-schema vocabulary.  A user agent can then use an
                implementation of JSON Hyper-Schema to provide an interface to the
                combination of the schema and instance documents as a single logical
                representation of a resource, just as with any single-document hypermedia
                representation format.
            </t>
            <t>
                Hyper-schemas allow representations to take up fewer bytes on the wire, and
                distribute the burden of link construction from the server to each client.
                A user agent need not construct a link unless a client application requests
                that link.  JSON Hyper-Schema can also be used on the server side to generate
                other link serializations or representation formats at runtime, or pre-emptively
                follow links to facilitate server push usage.
            </t>

                <t>
                    The terms "schema", "instance", and "meta-schema" are to be interpreted as

                    JSON Schema validation specification</xref>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The terms "link", "link context" (or "context"), "link target" (or "target"),
                    and "target attributes" are to be interpreted as defined in

                <t>
                    The term "user agent" is to be interpreted as defined in
                    <xref target="RFC7230">Section 2.1 of RFC 7230</xref>, generalized to apply
                    to any protocol that may be used in a hypermedia system rather than
                    specifically being an HTTP client.
                </t>
                <t>
                    This specification defines the following terms:

            <section title="Functionality">
                <t>
                    A JSON Hyper-Schema implementation is able to take a hyper-schema, an
                    instance, and in some cases client input, and produce a set of fully
                    resolved valid links.  As defined by
                    <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis">RFC 5988bis, section 2</xref>,
                    a link consists of a context, a typed relation, a target, and optionally
                    additional target attributes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The relation type and target attributes are taken directly from each link's
                    Link Description Object.  The context and target identifiers are constructed
                    from some combination of URI Templates, instance data, and (in the case
                    of the target identifier) client input.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The target is always fully identified by a URI.  Due to the lack of a URI
                    fragment identifier syntax for application/json and many other media types
                    that can be used with JSON Hyper-Schema, the context may be only partially
                    identified by a URI.  In such cases, the remaining identification will be
                    provided as a JSON Pointer.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A few IANA-registered link relation types are given specific semantics in
                    a JSON Hyper-Schema document.  A "self" link is used to interact with the
                    resource that the instance document represents, while "collection" and
                    "item" links identify resources for which collection-specific semantics
                    can be assumed.

                The <xref target="ldo">link description format</xref> can be used without JSON
                Schema, and use of this format can be declared by referencing the normative
                link description schema as the schema for the data structure that uses the links.
                The URI of the normative link description schema is:

                (draft-07 work-in-progress version).
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Hyper-Schema implementations are free to provide output in any format.
                However, a specific format is defined for use in the conformance test suite,
                which is also used to illustrate points in the
                <xref target="implementation">"Implementation Requirements"</xref>, and to
                show the output generated by <xref target="examples">examples</xref>.
                It is RECOMMENDED that implementations be capable of producing output
                in this format to facilitated testing.  The URI of the JSON Schema

                When multiple subschemas are applicable to a given sub-instance, all "link"

                    The process for resolving the "base" template can be different when being

                    This section references the work-in-progress RFC5988bis, with the expectation
                    that it will reach RFC before this specification does.
                </cref>
                A Link Description Object (LDO) is a serialization of the abstract link model
                defined in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis">RFC 5988bis, section 2</xref>.
                As described in that document, a link consists of a context, a relation type,
                a target, and optionally target attributes.  JSON Hyper-Schema's LDO provides
                all of these, along with additional features using JSON Schema to describe input
                for use with the links in various ways.
            </t>
            <t>
                Due to the use of URI Templates to identify link contexts and targets, as well
                as optional further use of client input when identifying targets, an LDO is
                a link template that may resolve to multiple links when used with a JSON
                instance document.
            </t>
            <t>
                A specific use of an LDO, typically involving a request and response across
                a protocol, is referred to as an operation.  For many protocols, multiple
                operations are possible on any given link.  The protocol is indicated by
                the target's URI scheme.  Note that not all URI schemes indicate a protocol
                that can be used for communications, and even resources with URI schemes that
                do indicate such protocols need not be available over that protocol.
            </t>
            <t>
                A Link Description Object MUST be an object, and the
                <xref target="href">"href"</xref> and <xref target="rel">"rel"</xref> properties
                MUST be present.  Each keyword is covered briefly in this section, with additional
                usage explanation and comprehensive examples given later in the document.

            <section title="Link context" anchor="context">
                <t>
                    In JSON Hyper-Schema, the link's context resource is, by default, the
                    sub-instance to which it is attached (as defined by
                    <xref target="json-schema-validation">Section 10.1 of the JSON Schema
                    validation specification</xref>).  This is often not the entire instance
                    document.  This default context can be changed using the keywords
                    in this section.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Depending on the media type of the instance, it may or may not be possible
                    to assign a URI to the exact default context resource.  In particular,
                    application/json does not define a URI fragment resolution syntax, so
                    properties or array elements within a plain JSON document cannot be fully
                    identified by a URI.  When it is not possible to produce a complete URI,
                    the position of the context SHOULD be conveyed by a the URI of the instance
                    document, together with a separate plain-string JSON Pointer.

                <t>
                    Implementations MUST be able to construct the link context's URI, and
                    (if necessary for full identification), a JSON Pointer in string representation
                    form as per <xref target="RFC6901">RFC 6901, section 5</xref> in place of
                    a URI fragment.  The process for constructing a URI based on a URI template

                        A well-known design pattern in hypermedia is to use a collection resource

                        If the protocol indicated by the URI scheme defines a specific method
                        that is suited to creating a resource with a server-assigned URI, then
                        a collection resource, as identified by these link relation types,
                        MUST NOT define semantics for that method that conflict with the semantics
                        of creating a collection member.  Collection resources MAY implement
                        item creation via such a protocol method, and user agents MAY assume
                        that any such operation, if it exists, has item creation semantics.

                        This property provides additional information beyond what
                        is present in the title.  The value MUST be a string.
                        While a title is preferably short, a description can be
                        used to go into more detail about the purpose and usage
                        of the link.

                        when fetching this resource.  This property value MAY be a media range
                        instead, using the same pattern defined in

                        This property is analogous to the "type" property of other link
                        serialization formats.  User agents MAY use this information to inform
                        the interface they present to the user before the link is followed,
                        but MUST NOT use this information in the interpretation of the resulting
                        data.  Instead, a client MUST use the media type given by the response for
                        run-time interpretation.  See the section on

                        <xref target="headerSchema">"headerSchema"</xref>.  If both
                        protocol-specific information and "targtMediaType" are present, then the
                        value of "targetMediaType" MUST be compatible with the protocol-specific
                        information, and SHOULD indicate the media type that will be returned in the
                        absence of content negotiation.

                            and flexibility by deferring most of its structure to the protocol
                            indicated by the URI scheme.  Note that a resource can be identified
                            by a URI with a dereferenceable scheme, yet not be accessible over

                        The protocol is determined by the "href" URI scheme, although note that

                    There are four ways to use client-supplied data with a link, and each
                    is addressed by a separate link description object keyword.  When performing
                    operations, clients SHOULD ignore schemas that are not relevant to their

                        The value of the "hrefSchema" link description property MUST be
                        a valid JSON Schema.  This schema is used to validate user input
                        or other user agent data for filling out the URI Template in

                        accepted for that single variable.

                    <t>
                        For template variables that can be resolved from the instance data,
                        if the instance data is valid against all applicable subschemas
                        in "hrefSchema", then it MUST be used to pre-populate the input
                        data set for that variable.

                    <t>
                        Note that even when data is pre-populated from the instance, the
                        validation schema for that variable in "hrefSchema" need not be identical
                        to the validation schema(s) that apply to the instance data's location.
                        This allows for different validation rules for user agent data, such as
                        supporting spelled-out months for date-time input, but using the standard
                        date-time format for storage.

                        After input is accepted, potentially overriding the pre-populated
                        instance data, the resulting data set MUST successfully validate
                        against the value of "hrefSchema".  If it does not then the link
                        MUST NOT be used.  If it is valid, then the process given in the

                        If present, this property is a schema for protocol-specific request
                        headers or analogous control and meta-data.  The value of this
                        object MUST be a valid JSON Schema.
                        The protocol is determined by the "href" URI scheme, although note that
                        resources are not guaranteed to be accessible over such a protocol.
                        The schema is advisory only; the target resource's behavior is not
                        constrained by its presence.

                    <t>
                        The purpose of this keyword is to advertise target resource interaction
                        features, and indicate to clients what headers and header values are
                        likely to be useful.  Clients MAY use the schema to validate relevant
                        headers, but MUST NOT assume that missing headers or values are forbidden
                        from use.  While schema authors MAY set "additionalProperties" to
                        false, this is NOT RECOMMENDED and MUST NOT prevent clients or user agents
                        from supplying additional headers when requests are made.

                        The exact mapping of the JSON data model into the headers is
                        protocol-dependent.  However, in most cases this schema SHOULD
                        specify a type of "object", and the property names SHOULD be
                        lower-cased forms of the control data field names.  See the

                At a high level, a conforming implementation will meet the following
                requirements.  Each of these requirements is covered in more detail in the
                individual keyword sections and keyword group overviews.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that the requirements around how an implementation MUST recognize
                "self", "collection", and "item" links are thoroughly covered in the
                <xref target="relationType">link relation type</xref> section and are not
                repeated here.

                While it is not a mandatory format for implementations, the output format used
                in the test suite summarizes what needs to be computed for each link before
                it can be used:

                        identifier syntax, then the URI includes a fragment.  Note that there

                    Before links can be used, they must be discovered by applying the hyper-schema

                    addition to collecting valid links, any <xref target="base">"base"</xref>
                    values necessary to resolve each LDO's URI Templates must also be located
                    and associated with the LDO through whatever mechanism is most useful for
                    the implementation's URI Template resolution process.
                </t>
                <t>
                    And implementation MUST support looking up links by either their
                    attachment pointer or context pointer, either by performing the look-up
                    or by providing the set of all links with both pointers determined

                    When performing look-ups by context pointer, links that are attached to

            <section title="URI Templating" anchor="uriTemplating">
                <t>
                    Three hyper-schema keywords are <xref target="RFC6570">URI Templates</xref>:
                    "base", "anchor", and "href".  Each are resolved separately to URI-references,
                    and then the anchor or href URI-reference is resolved against the base (which
                    is itself resolved against earlier bases as needed, each of which was first
                    resolved from a URI Template to a URI-reference).
                </t>
                <t>
                    All three keywords share the same algorithm for resolving variables from
                    instance data, which makes use of the "templatePointers" and "templateRequired"
                    keywords.  When resolving "href", both it and any "base" templates
                    needed for resolution to an absolute URI, the algorithm is modified to
                    optionally accept user input based on the "hrefSchema" keyword.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For each URI Template (T), the following pseudocode describes an algorithm for
                    resolving T into a URI-reference (R).  For the purpose of this algorithm:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>
                            "ldo.templatePointers" is an empty object if the keyword was not
                            present and "ldo.templateRequired" is likewise an empty array.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            "attachmentPointer" is the absolute JSON Pointer for the attachment
                            location of the LDO.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            "getApplicableSchemas()" returns an iterable set of all (sub)schemas
                            that apply to the attachment point in the instance.
                        </t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                    This algorithm should be applied first to either "href" or "anchor",
                    and then as needed to each successive "base".  The order is important,
                    as it is not always possible to tell whether a template will resolve
                    to a full URI or a URI-reference.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In English, the high-level algorithm is:
                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t>Populate template variable data from the instance</t>
                        <t>If input is desired, accept input</t>
                        <t>Check that all required variables have a value</t>
                        <t>Encode values into strings and fill out the template</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <preamble>
                        This is the high-level algorithm as pseudocode.  "T" comes from either
                        "href" or "anchor" within the LDO, or from "base" in a containing schema.
                        Pseudocode for each step follows.  "initialTemplateKeyword" indicates
                        which of the two started the process (since "base" is always resolved
                        in order to finish resolving one or the other of those keywords).

                            In some software environments the original JSON representation of a
                            number will not be available (there is no way to tell the difference
                            between 1.0 and 1), so any reasonable representation should be used.
                            Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types
                            (such as string or boolean) if the exact representation is
                            important.  If the number was provide as input in the form of a
                            string, the string used as input SHOULD be used.

                    Implementations MAY provide additional functionality coordinating the use of
                    JSON Hyper-Schema with other specifications, including but not limited to

                    communicating with resources via protocols as indicated by URI schemes.
                    <cref>
                        This is vague.  I'm trying to convey that most uses of Hyper-Schema
                        would benefit from including integration with the media types, URI schemes,
                        and protocols, such as automatically validating submission data against
                        "submissionSchema", encoding it according to "submissionMediaType",
                        examining the URI for the "http" or "https" scheme, validating JSON
                        representations of headers against "headerSchema", serializing them
                        into HTTP header format, and constructing the appropriate POST request.
                        While many of those activities are technically outside of the scope of
                        Hyper-Schema, coordinating all of them is specific to Hyper-Schema and
                        beneficial to automate.

                    challenges when used with streaming parsers.  It is not possible to
                    authoritatively fulfill these requirements without processing the entire

                    implementations MUST be clear on the nature of the response, and MUST
                    offer an option to block and wait until all data is processed and

                While JSON Hyper-Schema is a hypermedia format and therefore protocol-independent,
                it is expected that its most common use will be in HTTP systems, or systems
                using protocols such as CoAP that are explicitly analogous to HTTP.
            </t>
            <t>
                This section provides guidance on how to define links for use with each
                common HTTP method, and how collection resources impose additional constraints
                on the use of HTTP POST.  Additionally, guidance is provided on hinting at
                HTTP response header values and describing possible HTTP request headers
                that are relevant to the given resource.
            </t>
            <section title="One link per target and relation type">
                <t>
                    Link Description Objects do not directly indicate what operations, such
                    as HTTP methods, are supported by the target resource.  Instead, operations
                    should be inferred primarily from link <xref target="rel">relation types</xref>
                    and URI schemes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    This means that for each target resource and link relation type pair, schema
                    authors SHOULD only define a single LDO.  While it is possible to use
                    "allow" with "targetHints" to repeat a relation type and target pair with
                    different HTTP methods marked as allowed, this is NOT RECOMMENDED and may
                    not be well-supported by conforming implementations.
                </t>
                <t>
                    All information necessary to use each HTTP method can be conveyed in a
                    single LDO as explained in this section.  The "allow" field in "targetHints"
                    is intended simply to hint at which operations are supported, not to
                    separately define each operation.

                <t>
                    Note, however, that a resource may always decline an operation at runtime,
                    for instance due to authorization failure, or due to other application state
                    that controls the operation's availability.

                    The relationship between a resource's representation and HTTP requests and
                    responses is determined by <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 4.3.1 -
                    "GET", section 4.3.4 "PUT", and section 3.1.4.2, "Content-Location"</xref>.
                    In particular, "targetSchema" suggests what a client can expect for the
                    response to an HTTP GET or any response for which the "Content-Location"
                    header is equal to the request URI, and what a client should send if it
                    replaces the resource in an HTTP PUT request.

                    The media type of the representation is given by the "targetMediaType"
                    field.  Alternatively, possible available media types MAY be advertised
                    for HTTP-accessible resources using the "accept" field in "headerSchema",
                    corresponding to the HTTP "Accept" header.

                    PATCH is determined by the combination of "targetSchema" and the request
                    media type, which is conveyed by the "Accept-Patch" header.  Media types
                    that are suitable for PATCH-ing define a syntax for expressing changes
                    to a document, which can be applied to the representation described by
                    "targetSchema" to determine the set of syntactically valid request payloads.

                    HTTP POST request payloads are described by the "submissionSchema" and

                    can be used to specify the necessary media type, and MAY be
                    advertised via the "targetHints" field.

                        the use of "Accept-Post" in "targetHints" seems incorrect.

                    Our "thing" has a server-assigned id, which is required in order to
                    construct the "self" link.  It also has a "data" field which can be
                    of any type.  The reason for the "definitions" section will be clear
                    in the next example.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Note that "id" is not required by the validation schema, but is required
                    by the self link.  This makes sense: a "thing" only has a URI if it has
                    been created, and the server has assigned an id.  However, you can use
                    this schema with an instance containing only the data field, which allows
                    you to validate "thing" instances that you are about to create.

                    Let's add a link to our entry point schema that lets you jump directly
                    to a particular thing if you can supply it's id as input.  To save space,
                    only the new LDO is shown.  Unlike "self" and "about", there is no
                    IANA-registered relationship about hypothetical things, so an extension
                    relationship is defined using the

                    The "href" value here is the same, but everything else is different.
                    Recall that the instance is an empty object, so "id" cannot be resolved
                    from instance data.  Instead it is required as client input.  This LDO
                    could also have used "hrefRequired" but with "required" in "hrefSchema"
                    it is not strictly necessary.  Providing "hrefRequired" without marking
                    "id" as required in "hrefSchema" would lead to errors, as client input
                    is the only possible source for resolving this link.

                    When link relation of "self" is used to denote a full representation of an
                    object, the user agent SHOULD NOT consider the representation to be the
                    authoritative representation of the resource denoted by the target URI if
                    the target URI is not equivalent to or a sub-path of the URI used to request
                    the resource representation which contains the target URI with the "self"
                    link.

                        This whole section needs more work, but I do like having security
                        concerns around target interactions consolidated and addressed as a whole.
                    </cref>
                </t>
                <t>
                    The "targetMediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected
                    format of the link's target.
                    However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the
                    server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be
                    the only consideration, and the "targetMediaType" property of the link
                    MUST NOT be used.
                    User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the
                    link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                    If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD
                    first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to
                    that external program.
                </t>
                <t>
                    This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the
                    precautions for "targetSchema".
                </t>
                <t>
                    The "targetSchema" keyword has similar security concerns to that of
                    "targetMediaType".
                    Clients MUST NOT use the value of this property to aid in the interpretation
                    of the data received in response to following the link, as this leaves
                    "safe" data open to re-interpretation.

        <section title="Using JSON Hyper-Schema in APIs" anchor="apis">
            <t>
                Hypermedia APIs, which follow the constraints of the REST architectural
                style, enable the creation of generic user agents.  Such a user agent
                has no application-specific knowledge.  Rather, it understands pre-defined
                media types, URI schemes, protocols, and link relations, often by recognizing
                these and coordinating the use of existing software that implements support
                for them.  Client applications can then be built on top of such a user agent,
                focusing on their own semantics and logic rather than the mechanics of the
                interactions.
            </t>
            <t>
                Hyper-schema is only concerned with one resource and set of associated links
                at a time.  Just as a web browser works with only one HTML page at a time,
                with no concept of whether or how that page functions as part of a "site",
                a hyper-schema-aware user agent works with one resource at a time, without
                any concept of whether or how that resource fits into an API.
            </t>
            <t>
                Therefore, hyper-schema is suitable for use within an API, but is not suitable
                for the description of APIs as complete entities in their own right.  There is
                no way to describe concepts at the API scope, rather than the resource and
                link scope, and such descriptions are outside of the boundaries
                of JSON Hyper-Schema.
            </t>
            <section title="Resource evolution with Hyper-Schema">
                <t>
                    Since a given JSON Hyper-Schema is used with a single resource at a single
                    point in time, it has no inherent notion of versioning.  However, a given
                    resource can change which schema or schemas it uses over time, and the
                    URIs of these schemas can be used to indicate versioning information.
                    When used with a media type that supports indicating a schema with a media
                    type parameter, these versioned schema URIs can be used in content negotiation.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A resource can indicate that it is an instance of multiple schemas, which allows
                    supporting multiple compatible versions simultaneously.  A client application
                    can then make use of the hyper-schema that it recognizes, and ignore newer
                    or older versions.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Responses and errors">
                <t>
                    Because a hyper-schema represents a single resource at a time, it does not
                    provide for an enumeration of all possible responses to protocol operations
                    performed with links.  Each response, including errors, is considered
                    its own (possibly anonymous) resource, and should identify its own
                    hyper-schema, and optionally use an appropriate media type such as
                    <xref target="RFC7807">RFC 7807's "application/problem+json"</xref>,
                    to allow the user agent or client application to interpret any
                    information that is provided beyond the protocol's own status reporting.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Static analysis of an API's hyper-schemas">
                <t>
                    It is possible to statically analyze a set of hyper-schemas without instance
                    data in order to generate output such as documentation or code.  However,
                    the full feature set of both validation and hyper-schema cannot be accessed
                    without runtime instance data.
                </t>
                <t>
                    This is an intentional design choice to provide the maximum runtime
                    flexibility for hypermedia systems.  JSON Schema as a media type allows for
                    establishing additional vocabularies for static analysis and content
                    generation, which are not addressed in this specification.  Additionally,
                    individual systems may restrict their usage to subsets that can be
                    analyzed statically if full design-time description is a goal.

                        Vocabularies for API documentation and other purposes have been
