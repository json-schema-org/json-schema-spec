                This document describes how JSON Schema can be used to define hyperlinks on instance data.

                    This example schema defines the properties of the instance.
                    For the "imgData" property, it specifies that that it should be base64-decoded and the resulting binary data treated as a PNG image.
                    It also defines link relations for the instance, with URIs incorporating values from the instance.
                    <cref>"id" probably should not normally be a required keyword, since new instances will have an unknown "id" property until is it assigned by the server. However, this property is used in a link, and without it, multiple different instances would be given the same rel=self URI!</cref>

                    Hyper-schemas MUST NOT be applied to an instance if the instance fails
                    to validate against the validation keywords within or containing the hyper-schema.
                    Hyper-schema keywords in branches of an "anyOf" or "oneOf" that do not
                    validate, or in a "dependencies" subschema that is not relevant
                    to the instance, MUST be ignored.

                <t>
                    Hyper-schema keywords in a subschema contained within

                    against the schema.  While finding a single validating element
                    is sufficient to determine the validation outcome, when hyper-schema
                    keywords are present, the subschema MUST be evaluated against all array elements.

                        hint may be added in a future draft (see issue #73 in the GitHub repository).

                    There are several ways that a client can use data can with a link:
                    <list>
                        <t> URI Template variables resolved from server-supplied instance data </t>
                        <t> URI Template variables resolved from user agent data </t>
                        <t> Replacing or modifying the target resource's representation </t>
                        <t> Submitting data for processing, where the data has no
                            inherent relation to the target resource's representation</t>
                    </list>
                    The three ways to use client-supplied data are each addressed by a separate
                    schema keyword within the link description object.  Link operations
                    ignore schemas that are not relevant to their semantics.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Link Description Objects do not directly indicate what operations, such
                    as HTTP methods, are supported by the target resource.  Instead, operations
                    should be inferred primarily from link <xref target="rel">relation types</xref>
                    and URI schemes.  Note, however, that a resource may always decline an operation at
                    runtime, for instance due to application state that controls the operation's
                    availability.

                        URI Template variables in <xref target="href">"href"</xref> resolve from
                        server-supplied instance data by default.
                        <xref target="hrefSchema">"hrefSchema"</xref> allows a link to specify
                        a schema for resolving template variables from client-supplied data.
                        Regular JSON Schema validation features can be used to require resolution
                        from user agent data, forbid it, or allow user agent data while falling back to
                        server-supplied instance data if no user agent data is provided.

                    <t>
                        The common pattern of resolving a templated path component with
                        server-supplied instance data while accepting user agent data to build
                        a query string can be implemented by setting the "hrefSchema" subschemas
                        for the path template variables to false, while giving the query string
                        template variables names that do not appear in the instance.  This ensures
                        that the path variables can only be resolved from the instance, and the
                        query string variables can only be resolved from user agent data.
                        See the "hrefSchema" section for an example of this approach.

                        supplies a non-authoritative description of the target resource's representation.
                        A client can use "targetSchema" to structure input for replacing or
                        modifying the representation.  Alternatively, if "targetSchema" is absent
                        or if the client prefers to only use authoritative information, it can
                        interact with the target resource to confirm or discover its representation
                        structure.

                        The value of "href" is to be used as a URI Template, as defined in <xref target="RFC6570">RFC 6570</xref>.  However, some special considerations apply:
                    </t>

                    <section title="Values for substitution">
                        <t>
                            The URI Template is filled out using data from some combination of an external source and the instance.
                            Where either instance data or user agent data may be used, this section will refer simply to "data" or to a "value".
                            When the source is important, it is specified explicitly.

                            To allow the use of any object property (including the empty string) or array index, the following rules are defined:
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            For a given variable name in the URI Template, the value to use is determined as follows:
                            <list>
                                <t>If the data is an array, and the variable name is a representation of a non-negative integer, then the value at the corresponding array index MUST be used (if it exists).</t>
                                <t>Otherwise, the variable name should be percent-decoded, and the corresponding object property MUST be used (if it exists).</t>

                            user agent data is provided, the data MUST be a valid instance according
                            to the value of "hrefSchema".
                            Template variables, after the process listed above, MUST first
                            be resolved from the user agent data instance.  Any variables left
                            unresolved MUST be resolved from the resource instance data.

                                When any value referenced by the URI template is null, a boolean or a number, then it should first be converted into a string as follows:

                                    <t>null values SHOULD be replaced by the text "null"</t>
                                    <t>boolean values SHOULD be replaced by their lower-case equivalents: "true" or "false"</t>

                                In some software environments the original JSON representation of a number will not be available (there is no way to tell the difference between 1.0 and 1), so any reasonable representation should be used.
                                Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types (such as string or boolean) if the exact representation is important.

                            Sometimes, the appropriate values will not be available.
                            For example, the template might specify the use of object properties, but no such data was provided (or "hrefSchema" is not present), and the instance is an array or a string.

                            If any of the values required for the template are neither present in the user agent data (if relevant) nor the JSON instance, then substitute values MAY be provided from another source (such as default values).
                            Otherwise, the link definition SHOULD be considered not to apply to the instance.

                        A suitable instance described by this schema would have four links defined.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "self" would have an expected MIME type of "application/json" (the default).
                        The two links with a "rel" value of "alternate" specify the locations of HTML and RSS versions of the current item.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "icon" links to an image, but does not specify the exact format.

                    A visual user agent displaying the item from the above example might present a button representing an RSS feed, which when pressed passes the target URI (calculated "href" value) to an view more suited to displaying it, such as a news feed aggregator tab.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Note that presenting the link in the above manner, or passing the URI to a news feed aggregator view does not constitute interpretation of the data, but an interpretation of the link.
                    The interpretation of the data itself is performed by the news feed aggregator, which SHOULD reject any data that would not have also been interpreted as a news feed, had it been displayed in the main view.

                    <t>
                        The "mediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected format of the link's target.
                        However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be the only consideration, and the "mediaType" property of the link MUST NOT be used.
                        User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                        If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to that external program.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the precautions for "targetSchema".
