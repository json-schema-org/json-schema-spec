                    Hyper-schema keywords can be applied when the instance is valid against
                    the schema that includes those keywords.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Hyper-schemas MUST NOT be applied to an instance if the instance fails to
                    validate against the validation keywords within or containing the hyper-schema.
                    Hyper-schema keywords in branches of an "anyOf", "oneOf", or "if"/"then"/"else"
                    that do not validate, or in a "dependencies" subschema that is not relevant
                    to the instance, MUST be ignored.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Hyper-schema keywords in a subschema contained within a "not", at any depth,

                    If the subschema for a "contains" keyword contains hyper-schema keywords they
                    MUST be applied to all array elements that validate against the schema.  While
                    finding a single validating element is sufficient to determine the validation
                    outcome, when hyper-schema keywords are present, the subschema MUST be evaluated
                    against all array elements.

        <section title="Link Description Object">
            <t>
                A Link Description Object (LDO) is used to describe a single link relation from the
                instance to another resource.
                A Link Description Object must be an object.
            </t>

            <t>
                The link description format can be used without JSON Schema, and use of this format
                can be declared by referencing the normative link description schema as the schema
                for the data structure that uses the links.
                The URI of the normative link description schema is:
                <eref target="http://json-schema.org/draft-06/links">http://json-schema.org/draft-06/links</eref>
                (draft-06 version).

                        Note that while the current draft does not provide a way to explicity
                        indicate HTTP method support, some way of providing a non-authoritative
                        hint may be added in a future draft (see issue #73 in the GitHub repository).
                    </cref>
                </t>
                <t>
                    An operation is a specific use of a link described by an LDO, after any
                    template variables have been resolved.
                </t>
                <t>
                    There are several ways that a client can use data with a link:
                    <list>
                        <t> URI Template variables resolved from server-supplied instance data </t>
                        <t> URI Template variables resolved from user agent data </t>
                        <t> Replacing or modifying the target resource's representation </t>
                        <t> Submitting data for processing, where the data has no
                            inherent relation to the target resource's representation</t>
                    </list>
                    The three ways to use client-supplied data are each addressed by a separate
                    schema keyword within the link description object.  When performing operations,
                    clients SHOULD ignore schemas that are not relevant to their semantics.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Link Description Objects do not directly indicate what operations, such
                    as HTTP methods, are supported by the target resource.  Instead, operations
                    should be inferred primarily from link <xref target="rel">relation types</xref>
                    and URI schemes.  Note, however, that a resource may always decline an operation
                    at runtime, for instance due to application state that controls the operation's
                    availability.
                </t>

                    <t>
                        URI Template variables in <xref target="href">"href"</xref> resolve from
                        server-supplied instance data by default.  This data is drawn from the
                        sub-instance that validated against the schema containing the LDO.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        <xref target="templatePointers">"templatePointers"</xref> allows adjusting
                        the location from which instance data is resolved on a per-variable
                        basis.

                    <t>
                        <xref target="hrefSchema">"hrefSchema"</xref> allows a link to specify
                        a schema for resolving template variables from client-supplied data.
                        Regular JSON Schema validation features can be used to require resolution
                        from user agent data, forbid it, or allow user agent data while falling back

                            The URI Template is filled out using data from some combination of an
                            external source and the instance.
                            Where either instance data or user agent data may be used, this section
                            will refer simply to "data" or to a "value".
                            When the source is important, it is specified explicitly.

                            To allow the use of any object property (including the empty string) or
                            array index, the following rules are defined:

                            For a given variable name in the URI Template, the value to use is
                            determined as follows:
                            <list>

                                    If the data is an array, and the variable name is a
                                    representation of a non-negative integer, then the value at the
                                    corresponding array index MUST be used (if it exists).

                                    Otherwise, the variable name should be percent-decoded, and the

                            Template variables, after the process listed above, MUST first

                                Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types

                            Sometimes, the appropriate values will not be available.  In many
                            cases, the URI Template behavior of simply removing variables that
                            do not have a value will be appropriate.  An example of this is
                            optional query parameters, the presence or absence of which does

                            or would require a different link relation type.  While "hrefSchema" can

                            some variables must be resolved from instance data.  When that instance

                    The value of the "rel" property indicates the name of the relation to the target
                    resource. The value MUST be a registered link relation from the
                    <xref target="RFC5988">IANA Link Relation Type Registry established in RFC 5988</xref>,
                    or a normalized URI following the <xref target="RFC3986">URI production of RFC 3986</xref>.
                    This property is required.
                </t>

                <t>
                    As defined by RFC 5988, a link connects a context resource
                    to a target resource, where the nature of the connection
                    is described by the link relation type.  The context
                    resource is the instance to which the schema (or sub-schema)
                    applies, rather than any larger document in which the
                    instance may have been found.  The context may be changed
                    with the <xref target="anchor">"anchor"</xref> or
                    <xref target="anchorPointer">"anchorPointer"</xref> properties.

                <t>
                    Depending on the media type of the instance, it may or may
                    not be possible to assign a URI to the exact default context
                    resource.  In particular, application/json does not define
                    URI fragment resolution semantics, so properties or array
                    elements within a plain JSON document cannot be identified
                    by a URI.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Relationship definitions are not normally media type
                    dependent, and users are encouraged to utilize the most
                    suitable existing accepted relation definitions.
                </t>

                <t>
                    When no registered relation (aside from "related") applies, users are
                    encouraged to mint their own extension relation types, as described in
                    <xref target="RFC5988">section 4.2 of RFC 5988</xref>.  The simplest
                    approaches for choosing link relation type URIs are to either use
                    a URI scheme that is already in use to identify the system's primary
                    resources, or to use a human-readable, non-dereferenceable URI scheme
                    such as <xref target="RFC4151">"tag", defined by RFC 4151</xref>.
                    Extension relation type URIs need not be dereferenceable, even when
                    using a scheme that allows it.

                        in hypermedia is to use a collection resource to create a member of the
                        collection and give it a server-assigned URI.  When using HTTP, or a protocol
                        such as CoAP that is explicitly analogous to HTTP, this is done by POST-ing
                        a representation of the individual resource to be created to the collection

                    syntax for application/json means that it is usually not possible to

                    to construct a pointer to another property in that same nested JSON object.

                        A suitable instance described by this schema would have four links defined.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "self" would have an expected MIME type of
                        "application/json" (the default).
                        The two links with a "rel" value of "alternate" specify the locations of
                        HTML and RSS versions of the current item.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "icon" links to an image, but does not
                        specify the exact format.

                    A visual user agent displaying the item from the above example might present a
                    button representing an RSS feed, which when pressed passes the target URI
                    (calculated "href" value) to an view more suited to displaying it, such as a

                    Note that presenting the link in the above manner, or passing the URI to a news

                    interpretation of the link.
                    The interpretation of the data itself is performed by the news feed aggregator,
                    which SHOULD reject any data that would not have also been interpreted as a news
                    feed, had it been displayed in the main view.

                        The "targetMediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected
                        format of the link's target.
                        However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the
                        server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be
                        the only consideration, and the "targetMediaType" property of the link
                        MUST NOT be used.
                        User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the
                        link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                        If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD
                        first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to
                        that external program.

                    <t>
                        This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the
                        precautions for "targetSchema".

                        As with "targetHints", this keyword is somewhat under-specified
                        to encourage experimentation and feedback as we try to balance
                        flexibility and clarity.

                <t>
                    If present, this property is a schema for protocol-specific request
                    headers or analogous control and meta-data.  The value of this
                    object MUST be a valid JSON Schema.
                    The protocol is determined by the "href" URI scheme, although note that
                    resources are not guaranteed to be accessible over such a protocol.
                    The schema is advisory only; the target resource's behavior is not
                    constrained by its presence.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The purpose of this keyword is to advertise target resource interaction
                    features, and indicate to clients what headers and header values are
                    likely to be useful.  Clients MAY use the schema to validate relevant
                    headers, but MUST NOT assume that missing headers or values are forbidden
                    from use.  While schema authors MAY set "additionalProperties" to
                    false, this is NOT RECOMMENDED and MUST NOT prevent clients or user agents
                    from supplying additional headers when requests are made.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The exact mapping of the JSON data model into the headers is
                    protocol-dependent.  However, in most cases this schema SHOULD
                    specify a type of "object", and the property names SHOULD be
                    lower-cased forms of the control data field names.
                </t>
                <t>
                    "headerSchema" is applicable to any request method or command that the
                    protocol supports.  When generating a request, clients SHOULD ignore
                    schemas for headers that are not relevant to that request.

                        <xref target="I-D.reschke-http-jfv">"A JSON Encoding for HTTP Header Field Values"</xref>
                        Approaches shown in that document's examples SHOULD be applied to
                        other similarly structured headers wherever possible.

                        several standard values and allows for extension values.

                            Each name/value preference pair is a single value of the
                            header, so each object in the list can only have one such
                            pair.  Simplifying the "response-async" value to a single string
                            is based on the "Accept-Encoding" example in

                        single string and name/value pair preferences to take additional
                        name/value parameters.  While a single-string preference can accomodate
                        such parameters following the "Accept-Encoding" example, there is
                        no example to date of a name/value pair with parameters.

                    the target information resource (including for replacing the contents of the
                    resource in a PUT request), unlike "submissionSchema" which describes the
                    user-submitted request data to be evaluated by the resource. "submissionSchema"
                    is intended for use with requests that have payloads that are not defined in
                    terms of the target representation.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Omitting "submissionSchema" or setting the entire schema to "false" prevents
                    any user agent data from being accepted.
