                This document describes how JSON Schema can be used to define hyperlinks on instance data.

                    This example schema defines the properties of the instance.
                    For the "imgData" property, it specifies that that it should be base64-decoded and the resulting binary data treated as a PNG image.
                    It also defines link relations for the instance, with URIs incorporating values from the instance.
                    <cref>"id" probably should not normally be a required keyword, since new instances will have an unknown "id" property until is it assigned by the server. However, this property is used in a link, and without it, multiple different instances would be given the same rel=self URI!</cref>

                    Hyper-schema keywords in branches of an "anyOf" or "oneOf" that do not
                    validate, or in a "dependencies" subschema that is not relevant
                    to the instance, MUST be ignored.

                    against the schema.  While finding a single validating element
                    is sufficient to determine the validation outcome, when hyper-schema
                    keywords are present, the subschema MUST be evaluated against all array elements.

                    "Form"-like functionality can be defined by use of the <xref target="method">"method"</xref> and <xref target="schema">"schema"</xref> keywords, which supplies a schema describing the data to supply to the server.
                    Functionality equivalent to dynamic URI generation is available through the <xref target="href">"href"</xref> template and <xref target="hrefSchema">"hrefSchema"</xref>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The simplest kind of link has an "href" with no template variables, and no "schema".  This does not
                    allow for any variance in the link URI, nor does it allow for a request document.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An "href" with at least one template variable, but no "hrefSchema" or "schema", allows resolving
                    the template variable from the instance, but does not allow resolving it
                    from external data, nor does it allow a request document.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An "href" with at least one template variable and with an "hrefSchema" allows using external
                    data to resolve the template, and falls back to resolving any remaining variables from the instance.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A link with a "schema" allows submitting external data either as a request body (if "method" is "post"),
                    or as a URI query string (if "method" is "get").  Such a query string replaces any query string
                    present after the "href" template is resolved.

                    The value of the "href" link description property is a template used to determine the target URI of the related resource.
                    The value of the instance property MUST be resolved as a <xref target="RFC3986">URI-reference</xref> against the base URI of the instance.

                        <cref>
                            The pre-processing rules present in earlier drafts have been removed due to their complexity and inability to address all limitations with URI templating.  This section is subject to significant change in upcoming drafts to replace the old pre-processing with a comprehensive solution.
                        </cref>
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The value of "href" is to be used as a URI Template, as defined in <xref target="RFC6570">RFC 6570</xref>.  However, some special considerations apply:
                    </t>

                    <section title="Values for substitution">
                        <t>
                            The URI Template is filled out using data from some combination of an external source and the instance.
                            Where either instance data or external data may be used, this section will refer simply to "data" or to a "value".
                            When the source is important, it is specified explicitly.

                            To allow the use of any object property (including the empty string) or array index, the following rules are defined:
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            For a given variable name in the URI Template, the value to use is determined as follows:
                            <list>
                                <t>If the data is an array, and the variable name is a representation of a non-negative integer, then the value at the corresponding array index MUST be used (if it exists).</t>
                                <t>Otherwise, the variable name should be percent-decoded, and the corresponding object property MUST be used (if it exists).</t>
                            </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            If <xref target="hrefSchema">"hrefSchema"</xref> is present and
                            external input is provided, the input MUST be a valid instance according
                            to the value of "hrefSchema".
                            Template variables, after the process listed above, MUST first
                            be resolved from the external data instance.  Any variables left
                            unresolved MUST be resolved from the resource instance data.
                        </t>

                        <section title="Converting to strings">
                            <t>
                                When any value referenced by the URI template is null, a boolean or a number, then it should first be converted into a string as follows:
                                <list>
                                    <t>null values SHOULD be replaced by the text "null"</t>
                                    <t>boolean values SHOULD be replaced by their lower-case equivalents: "true" or "false"</t>
                                    <t>numbers SHOULD be replaced with their original JSON representation.</t>
                                </list>
                            </t>
                            <t>
                                In some software environments the original JSON representation of a number will not be available (there is no way to tell the difference between 1.0 and 1), so any reasonable representation should be used.
                                Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types (such as string or boolean) if the exact representation is important.
                            </t>
                        </section>

                    <section title="Missing values">
                        <t>
                            Sometimes, the appropriate values will not be available.
                            For example, the template might specify the use of object properties, but no such input was provide (or "hrefSchema" is not present), and the instance is an array or a string.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            If any of the values required for the template are present in neither the user input (if relevant) or the JSON instance, then substitute values MAY be provided from another source (such as default values).
                            Otherwise, the link definition SHOULD be considered not to apply to the instance.
                        </t>

            <section title="hrefSchema" anchor="hrefSchema">
                <t>
                    The value of the "hrefSchema" link description property MUST be
                    a valid JSON Schema.  This schema is used to validate user input
                    or other external data for filling out the URI Template in
                    <xref target="href">"href"</xref>, as described in that section.

                <t>
                    Omitting "hrefSchema" or setting the entire schema to "false" prevents
                    any external data from being accepted.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Implementations MUST NOT attempt to validate values resolved from
                    resource instance data with "hrefSchema".  This allows for different
                    validation rules for user input, such as supporting spelled-out
                    months for date-time input but using the standard date-time

                    The value of this property is advisory only, and represents the media type <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref>, that is expected to be returned when fetching this resource.
                    This property value MAY be a media range instead, using the same pattern defined in <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1 - HTTP "Accept" header</xref>.
                </t>

                <t>
                    This property is analogous to the "type" property of &lt;a&gt; elements in HTML (advisory content type), or the "type" parameter in the <xref target="RFC5988">HTTP Link header</xref>.
                    User agents MAY use this information to inform the interface they present to the user before the link is followed, but this information MUST NOT use this information in the interpretation of the resulting data.
                    When deciding how to interpret data obtained through following this link, the behaviour of user agents MUST be identical regardless of the value of the this property.

                <t>
                    If this property's value is specified, and the link's target is to be obtained using any protocol that supports the HTTP/1.1 "Accept" header <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1</xref>, then user agents MAY use the value of this property to aid in the assembly of that header when making the request to the server.

                        A suitable instance described by this schema would have four links defined.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "self" would have an expected MIME type of "application/json" (the default).
                        The two links with a "rel" value of "alternate" specify the locations of HTML and RSS versions of the current item.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "icon" links to an image, but does not specify the exact format.

                <t>
                    A visual user agent displaying the item from the above example might present a button representing an RSS feed, which when pressed passes the target URI (calculated "href" value) to an view more suited to displaying it, such as a news feed aggregator tab.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Note that presenting the link in the above manner, or passing the URI to a news feed aggregator view does not constitute interpretation of the data, but an interpretation of the link.
                    The interpretation of the data itself is performed by the news feed aggregator, which SHOULD reject any data that would not have also been interpreted as a news feed, had it been displayed in the main view.

                <section title="Security concerns for &quot;mediaType&quot;">
                    <t>
                        The "mediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected format of the link's target.
                        However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be the only consideration, and the "mediaType" property of the link MUST NOT be used.
                        User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                        If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to that external program.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the precautions for "targetSchema".

                    The following properties also apply to Link Description Objects, and provide functionality analogous to <xref target="W3C.CR-html5-20140731">HTML forms</xref>, by providing a means for making a request with client- or user-selected information.

                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If "method" is "get", the link identifies how a user can compute the URI of an arbitrary resource. For example, how compute a link to a page of search results relating to the instance, for a user-selected query term. Despite being named after GET, there is no constraint on the method or protocol used to interact with the remote resource.

                    <t>
                        If "method" is "post", the link specifies how a user can construct a document to submit to the link target for evaluation.

                    <t>
                        Values for this property SHOULD be lowercase, and SHOULD be compared case-insensitive. Use of other values not defined here SHOULD be ignored.

                    <t>
                        If present, this property indicates the media type format the client should use to encode a query parameter or send to the server. posting to the collection of instances at the target resource.
                        If the method is "get", this will indicate how to encode the query-string that is appended to the "href" link target.
                        If the method is "post", this indicates which media type to send to the server and how to encode it.

                        Note that this does not provide data for any URI templates.  That is handed by <xref target="hrefSchema">"hrefSchema"</xref>.  If the method is "get" and the resolved URI Template has a query string, the query string produced by input validated against "schema" replaces the existing query string.

                        This is a separate concept from the "targetSchema" property, which is describing the target information resource (including for replacing the contents of the resource in a PUT request), unlike "schema" which describes the user-submitted request data to be evaluated by the resource.
