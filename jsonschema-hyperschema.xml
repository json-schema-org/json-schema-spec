                This document describes how JSON Schema can be used to define hyperlinks on instance data.

                    This example schema defines the properties of the instance.
                    For the "imgData" property, it specifies that that it should be base64-decoded and the resulting binary data treated as a PNG image.
                    It also defines link relations for the instance, with URIs incorporating values from the instance.
                    <cref>"id" probably should not normally be a required keyword, since new instances will have an unknown "id" property until is it assigned by the server. However, this property is used in a link, and without it, multiple different instances would be given the same rel=self URI!</cref>

                            To allow the use of any JSON property name in the template, before using the value of "href" as a URI Template, the following pre-processing rules MUST be applied, in order:

                                The purpose of this step is to allow the use of brackets to percent-encode variable names inside curly brackets.
                                Variable names to be escaped are enclosed within rounded brackets, with the close-rounded-bracket character ")" being escaped as a pair of close-rounded-brackets "))".
                                Since the empty string is not a valid variable name in RFC 6570, an empty pair of brackets is replaced with "%65mpty".

                            <t>
                                The rules are as follows:

                                    <t>If the brackets contained no text (the empty string), then they are replaced with "%65mpty" (which is "empty" with a percent-encoded "e")</t>

                                            <t>all pairs of close-brackets "))" are replaced with a single close bracket</t>
                                            <t>after that, the text is replaced with its percent-encoded equivalent, such that the result is a valid RFC 6570 variable name (note that this requires encoding characters such as "*" and "!")</t>

                                After the above substitutions, if the character "$" (dollar sign) appears within a pair of curly brackets, then it MUST be replaced with the text "%73elf" (which is "self" with a percent-encoded "s").

                                The purpose of this stage is to allow the use of the instance value itself (instead of its object properties or array items) in the URI Template, by the special value "%73elf".

                                The special-case values of "%73elf" and "%65mpty" were chosen because they are unlikely to be accidentally generated by either a human or automated escaping.

                            After pre-processing, the URI Template is filled out using data from the instance.
                            To allow the use of any object property (including the empty string), array index, or the instance value itself, the following rules are defined:

                                When any value referenced by the URI template is null, a boolean or a number, then it should first be converted into a string as follows:

                                    <t>null values SHOULD be replaced by the text "null"</t>

                                In some software environments the original JSON representation of a number will not be available (there is no way to tell the difference between 1.0 and 1), so any reasonable representation should be used.
                                Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types (such as string or boolean) if the exact representation is important.

                    The value of this property is advisory only, and represents the media type <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref>, that is expected to be returned when fetching this resource.
                    This property value MAY be a media range instead, using the same pattern defined in <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1 - HTTP "Accept" header</xref>.
                </t>

                <t>
                    This property is analogous to the "type" property of &lt;a&gt; elements in HTML (advisory content type), or the "type" parameter in the <xref target="RFC5988">HTTP Link header</xref>.
                    User agents MAY use this information to inform the interface they present to the user before the link is followed, but this information MUST NOT use this information in the interpretation of the resulting data.
                    When deciding how to interpret data obtained through following this link, the behaviour of user agents MUST be identical regardless of the value of the this property.
                </t>

                <t>
                    If this property's value is specified, and the link's target is to be obtained using any protocol that supports the HTTP/1.1 "Accept" header <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1</xref>, then user agents MAY use the value of this property to aid in the assembly of that header when making the request to the server.

                    If this property's value is not specified, then the value should be taken to be "application/json".

                        A suitable instance described by this schema would have four links defined.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "self" would have an expected MIME type of "application/json" (the default).
                        The two links with a "rel" value of "alternate" specify the locations of HTML and RSS versions of the current item.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "icon" links to an image, but does not specify the exact format.

                <t>
                    A visual user agent displaying the item from the above example might present a button representing an RSS feed, which when pressed passes the target URI (calculated "href" value) to an view more suited to displaying it, such as a news feed aggregator tab.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Note that presenting the link in the above manner, or passing the URI to a news feed aggregator view does not constitute interpretation of the data, but an interpretation of the link.
                    The interpretation of the data itself is performed by the news feed aggregator, which SHOULD reject any data that would not have also been interpreted as a news feed, had it been displayed in the main view.
                </t>

                <section title="Security concerns for &quot;mediaType&quot;">
                    <t>
                        The "mediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected format of the link's target.
                        However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be the only consideration, and the "mediaType" property of the link MUST NOT be used.
                        User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                        If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to that external program.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the precautions for "targetSchema".

                    The following properties also apply to Link Description Objects, and provide functionality analogous to <xref target="W3C.CR-html5-20140731">HTML forms</xref>, by providing a means for making a request with client- or user-selected information.

                    <t>
                        This property specifies that the client can construct a templated query or non-idempotent request to a resource.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If "method" is "get", the link identifies how a user can compute the URI of an arbitrary resource. For example, how compute a link to a page of search results relating to the instance, for a user-selected query term. Despite being named after GET, there is no constraint on the method or protocol used to interact with the remote resource.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If "method" is "post", the link specifies how a user can construct a document to submit to the link target for evaluation.

                    <t>
                        Values for this property SHOULD be lowercase, and SHOULD be compared case-insensitive. Use of other values not defined here SHOULD be ignored.

                    <t>
                        If present, this property indicates the media type format the client should use to encode a query parameter or send to the server. posting to the collection of instances at the target resource.
                        If the method is "get", this will indicate how to encode the query-string that is appended to the "href" link target.
                        If the method is "post", this indicates which media type to send to the server and how to encode it.
