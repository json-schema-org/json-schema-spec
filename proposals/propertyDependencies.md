# JSON Schema Proposal: The `propertyDependencies` Keyword

## Abstract

The `propertyDependencies` keyword is a more friendly way to select between two
or more schemas to validate an instance against than is currently supported by
JSON Schema.

## Current Status

This proposal is complete and awaiting integration into the specification.

As some additional context, this proposal has been written prior to the stable
specification's initial release. As such, it will not be integrated until at
least the spec's second release at the earliest. It is also operating as a
proving grounds, of sorts, for the SDLC's Feature Life Cycle.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

A common need in JSON Schema is to select between one schema or another to
validate an instance based on the value of some property in the JSON instance.
There are a several patterns people use to accomplish this, but they all have
significant [problems](propertyDependencies-adr.md#problems). <!-- Update when moving ADR -->

OpenAPI solves this problem with the `discriminator` keyword. However, their
approach is more oriented toward code generation concerns, is poorly specified
when it comes to validation, and is coupled to OpenAPI concepts that don't exist
is JSON Schema. Therefore, it's necessary to define something new rather than
adopt or redefine `discriminator`.

### Solution

The `dependentSchemas` keyword is very close to what is needed except it checks
for the presence of a property rather than it's value. The chosen solution is to
build on that concept to solve this problem.

```json
{
  "propertyDependencies": {
    "foo": {
      "aaa": { "$ref": "#/$defs/foo-aaa" }
    }
  }
}
```

The validation result is equivalent to the following schema.

```json
{
  "if": {
    "properties": {
      "foo": { "const": "aaa" }
    },
    "required": ["foo"]
  },
  "then": { "$ref": "#/$defs/foo-aaa" }
}
```

### Limitations

The problem of choosing an alternative based on a property value could apply for
a value of any JSON type, but `propertyDependencies` only solves this problem
when the value is a string. One of the main goals of this keyword is to define
something that's intuitive enough and easy enough to use that people will
actually use it rather than fallback to `oneOf` because it's simple. Achieving
those goals means that some trade-offs need to be made.

## Change Description

The `propertyDependencies` keyword will be added to the `https://json-schema.org/vocab/applicator` [applicator
vocabulary](../jsonschema-core.html#applicatorvocab).

1. The following will be added to the JSON Schema Core specification as a
subsection of "Keywords for Applying Subschemas Conditionally".
    > ### `propertyDependencies`
    >
    > This keyword specifies subschemas that are evaluated if the instance is an
    > object and contains a certain property with a certain string value.
    >
    > This keyword's value MUST be an object. Each value in the object MUST be an
    > object whose values MUST be valid JSON Schemas.
    >
    > If the outer object key is a property in the instance and the inner object key
    > is equal to the value of that property, the entire instance must validate
    > against the schema. Its use is dependent on the presence and value of the
    > property.
    >
    > Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty object.
2. The following subschema will be added to the Applicator Vocabulary schema, `https://json-schema.org/<version>/<release>/meta/applicator` at `/properties/propertyDependencies`:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "object",
        "additionalProperties": {
          "$dynamicRef": "#meta",
          "default": true
        },
        "default": {}
      }
    }
    ```
