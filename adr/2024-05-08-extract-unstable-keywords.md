# Extract Unstable Features for Initial Release

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: @gregsdennis @jdesrosiers @bhutton
* Date: 2024-05-08

Technical Story:

@gregsdennis [proposed](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/1443#issuecomment-2099427543) that an ADR be created to document that unstable features be extracted before the stable release.

Also the [SDLC proposal](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/discussions/671) which lists features that need to be put into the proposal process.

## Context and Problem Statement

In creating a stable spec release, it's important that all included features are well-developed and their behaviors are finalized.  As such, the following features will be extracted before the stable release.

- `$vocabulary` - This feature is still in development.
- Output formats - This feature is being extracted to its own spec anyway.  (See [PR](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/pull/1429) for more info and link to discussion.)
- `propertyDependencies` - This feature is not technically in the spec and should go through the proposal process.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

We can't publish a stable spec that contains unstable features.  Thus we need to remove them.

## Considered Options

1. Extract unfinished features and put them through the proposal process.
2. Complete the features before releasing the spec.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Extract unfinished features and put them through the proposal process.

This allows us to release a stable version of the specification while continuing to develop these features.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We can release a spec earlier that fulfills our users' needs.
* We can continue to develop these features.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* These feature will be considered experimental until their proposals are accepted.  This may be a hindrance to adoption.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Extract unfinished features and put them through the proposal process

* Good, because we can release a spec earlier that fulfills our users' needs.
* Good, because we can continue to develop these features.
* Bad, because these features are experimental now.

### Complete the features before releasing the spec

* Good, because the features will be ready to use when the spec releases.
* Bad, because the spec may not release if we can't finalize the features.
