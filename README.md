# JSON Schema

## Welcome

JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to validate, annotate, and manipulate JSON documents.

This repository contains the sources for the **work in progress** of the next JSON Schema IETF Internet Draft (I-D) document.
For released versions, please see the [Previous Versions](#previous-versions) section.

## Call for reviews

Specifications are starting to get written. Reviews, comments, and suggestions
are of paramount importance to JSON Schema. It is humbly asked of you, dear
reader, that you bring your contributions.

## Development

1.  [Download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), being
    sure to add Python to the system path.

2.  Follow the [install instructions for xml2rfc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xml2rfc/).
    (It was problematic for me on Windows, so for me the simplest solution
    was to downgrade Python to 2.7.11 and utilize the [lxml installer](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.5.0#downloads)
    for 2.7, avoiding certain errors for the C++ compiler with this library
    used by xml2rfc.)

3.  Run `npm install`.
