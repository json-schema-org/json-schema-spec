JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to validate, annotate, and manipulate JSON documents.

This repository contains the sources for the **work in progress** of the next set of JSON Schema IETF Internet Draft (I-D) documents.
For the latest released I-Ds, please see the [Specification page](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) on the website.

## Authoring and Building

### Specification
To build the spec files to HTML from the Markdown sources, run `npm run
build-all`. You can also build each individually with `npm run build --
specs/filename.md` (Example: `npm run build -- specs/jsonschema-core.md`). You
can also use wildcards to build multiple specs at the same time: `npm run build
-- specs/jsonschema-*.md`. The HTML files will be available in the `web` folder.

The spec is built using [Remark](https://remark.js.org/), a markdown engine with
good support for plugins and lots of existing plugins we can use. Remark also
has a [language server](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-language-server) and
a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/remarkjs/vscode-remark) we can use to
get linting an link checking while developing the spec.

#### Plugins
The following is a not-necessarily-complete list of configured plugins and the
features they make available to you.

- [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) -- Enforce markdown
  styles guide.
- [remark-validate-links](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-validate-links) --
  Check for broken links.
- [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) -- Adds support for
  Github Flavored Markdown specific markdown features such as autolink literals,
  footnotes, strikethrough, tables, and tasklists.
- [remark-heading-id](https://github.com/imcuttle/remark-heading-id) -- Adds
  support for `{#my-anchor}` syntax to add an `id` to an element so it can be
  referenced using URI fragment syntax.
- [remark-headings](/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/main/remark-headings.js)
  -- A collection of enhancements for headings.
  - Adds hierarchical section numbers to headings.
    - Use the `%appendix%` prefix on headings that should be numbered as an
      appendix.
  - Adds id anchors to headers that don't have one
    - Example: `#section-2-13`
    - Example: `#appendix-a`
  - Makes the heading a link utilizing its anchor
- [remark-reference-links](/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/main/remark-reference-link.js)
  -- Adds new syntax for referencing a section of the spec using the section
  number as the link text.
    - Example:
    ```markdown
    ## Foo {#foo}

    ## Bar
    This is covered in {{foo}} // --> Renders to "This is covered in [Section 2.3](#foo)"
    - Link text will use "Section" or "Appendix" as needed
    ```
- [remark-table-of-contents](/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/main/remark-table-of-contents.js)
  -- Adds a table of contents in a section with a header called "Table of
  Contents".
- [remark-code-titles](/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/main/remark-code-titles.js)
  -- Add titles to code blocks
  - Example:
    ```markdown
    \`\`\`jsonschema "My Fun Title"
    { "type": "string" }
    \`\`\`
    ```
  - The languages `jsonschema` and `json` have special styling
  - The title will be parsed as a JSON string, but you have to double escape
    escaped characters. So, to get `My "quoted" title`, you would need to be
    `"My \\\\"quoted\\\\" title"`.
- [remark-torchlight](https://github.com/torchlight-api/remark-torchlight) --
  Syntax highlighting and more using https://torchlight.dev. Features include
  line numbers and line highlighting.
- [remark-flexible-containers](https://github.com/ipikuka/remark-flexible-containers)
  -- Add a callout box using the following syntax. Supported container types are
  `warning`, `note`, and `experimental`.

    ```
    ::: {type} {title}
    {content}
    :::
    ```

### Internet-Drafts
To build components that are being maintained as IETF Internet-Drafts, run
`make`. The Makefile will create the necessary Python venv for you as part of
the regular make target.

`make clean` will remove all output including the venv. To clean just the spec
output and keep the venv, use `make spec-clean`.

If you want to run `xml2rfc` manually after running make for the first time, you
will need to activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`.

The version of "xml2rfc" that this project uses is updated by modifying
`requirements.in` and running `pip-compile requirements.in`.

Descriptions of the xml2rfc, I-D documents, and RFC processes:

* https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/authoring/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html
* https://www.ietf.org/tao.html
* https://www.ietf.org/ietf-ftp/1id-guidelines.html
* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7322.txt

## Test suites

Conformance tests for JSON Schema and its vocabularies may be found
[in their own repository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite).

## The website

The JSON Schema web site is at http://json-schema.org/

The source for the website is [maintained in a separate repository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website).
