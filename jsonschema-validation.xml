            <t>
                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is instance
                validation. The validation process may be interactive or non interactive. For
                instance, applications may use JSON Schema to build a user interface enabling
                interactive content generation in addition to user input checking, or validate data
                retrieved from various sources. This specification describes schema keywords
                dedicated to validation purposes.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are materialized by a set of
                keywords which are described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is defined to assist in interactive instance generation. Those are also described in
                this specification.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification will use the terminology defined by the JSON Schema core
                specification. It is advised that readers have a copy of this specification.
            </t>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification uses the term "property set" to refer to the set of an object's
                member names; for instance, the property set of JSON Object { "a": 1, "b": 2 } is [
                "a", "b" ].
            </t>

            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are equal, as defined by the core specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability considerations">

            <section title="Validation of string instances">

                <t>
                    It should be noted that the nul character (\x00) is valid in a JSON string. An
                    instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless
                    of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Validation of numeric instances">

                <t>
                    The JSON specification does not define any bounds to the scale or precision of
                    numeric values. JSON Schema does not define any such bounds either. This means
                    that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
                    have an arbitrarily large decimal part, regardless of the ability of the
                    underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Regular expressions">

                <t>
                    Two validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular
                    expressions to express constraints. These regular expressions SHOULD
                    be valid according to the <xref target="ecma262">ECMA 262</xref> regular
                    expression dialect.
                </t>
                
                <t>
                    Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support,
                    schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression
                    tokens:

                    <list>
                        <t>individual Unicode characters, as defined by the <xref
                        target="RFC4627">JSON specification</xref>;</t>
                        <t>simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);</t>
                        <t>complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);</t>
                        <t>simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or
                        one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");</t>
                        <t>range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at
                        most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy
                        versions;</t>
                        <t>the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;</t>
                        <t>simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").</t>
                    </list>
                </t>

                <t>
                    Finally, implementations MUST NOT consider that regular expressions are
                    anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance,
                    that "es" matches "expression".
                </t>

            </section>

        </section>

        <section title="General validation considerations">

            <section title="Keywords and instance primitive types">

                <t>
                    Some validation keywords only apply to one or more primitive types. When the
                    primitive type of the instance cannot be validated by a given keyword,
                    validation for this keyword and instance SHOULD succeed.
                </t>

                <t>
                    This specification groups keywords in different sections, according to the
                    primitive type, or types, these keywords validate. Note that some keywords
                    validate all instance types.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Inter-dependent keywords">

                <t>
                    In order to validate an instance, some keywords are influenced by the presence
                    (or absence) of other keywords. In this case, all these keywords will be grouped
                    in the same section.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Default values for missing keywords">

                <t>
                    Some keywords, if absent, MAY be regarded by implementations as having
                    a default value. In this case, the default value will be mentioned.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Validation of container instances">

                <t>
                    Keywords with the possibility to validate container instances (arrays or
                    objects) only validate the instances themselves and not their children (array
                    items or object properties). Some of these keywords do, however, contain
                    information which is necessary for calculating which schema(s) a child must be
                    valid against. The algorithms to calculate a child instance's relevant schema(s)
                    are explained in a separate section.
                </t>

                <t>
                    It should be noted that while an array element will only have to validate
                    against one schema, object member values may have to validate against more than
                    one schema.

                            In this case, validation of the instance depends on the property set of
                            "properties" and "patternProperties". In this section, the property
                            names of "patternProperties" will be called regexes for convenience.
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            The first step is to collect the following sets:

                            <list style="hanging">
                                <t hangText="s">The property set of the instance to validate.</t>
                                <t hangText="p">The property set from "properties".</t>
                                <t hangText="pp">The property set from "patternProperties".</t>
                            </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            Having collected these three sets, the process is as follows:

                            <list>
                                <t>remove from "s" all elements of "p", if any;</t>
                                <t>for each regex in "pp", remove all elements of "s" which this
                                regex matches.</t>
                            </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            Validation of the instance succeeds if, after these two
                            steps, set "s" is empty.
                        </t>
                    </section>

                            The three property sets are:

                            <list style="hanging">
                                <t hangText="s">[ "p1", "p2", "a32&amp;o", "", "fiddle", "apple"

                            </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            Applying the two steps of the algorithm:

                            <list>
                                <t>after the first step, "p1" is removed from "s";</t>
                                <t>after the second step, "p2" (matched by "p"), "a32&amp;o"
                                (matched by "[0-9]") and "apple" (matched by "p") are removed from
                                "s".</t>
                            </list>
                        </t>

                        <t>
                            The set "s" still contains two elements, "" and "fiddle". Validation
                            therefore fails.

            <section title="Foreword">
                <t>
                    Structural validation alone may be insufficient to validate that an instance
                    meets all the requirements of an application. The "format" keyword is defined to
                    allow interoperable semantic validation for a fixed subset of values which are
                    accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external
                    specifications.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A
                    format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If
                    the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this
                    format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Implementations MAY support the "format" keyword. Should they choose to do so:
                    
                    <list>
                        <t>they SHOULD implement validation for attributes defined below;</t>

                    keyword and/or custom format attributes.

                    Calculating the schema, or schemas, a child instance must validate against is

                    value, which will be recalled in this section.
