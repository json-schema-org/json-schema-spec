                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is JSON instance validation.
                This document specifies a vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON documents,
                provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data,
                and to make assertions about what a valid document must look like.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using
                keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is also defined to assist in interactive, user interface instance generation.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification will use the terminology defined by the
                <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema core</xref> specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "property set" to refer to the set of an object's
                member names; for instance, the property set of JSON Object { "a": 1, "b": 2 } is
                [ "a", "b" ].
            </t>
            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are <xref target="json-schema">equal</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability considerations">

            <section title="Validation of string instances">
                <t>
                    It should be noted that the nul character (\u0000) is valid in a JSON string. An
                    instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless
                    of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Validation of numeric instances">
                <t>
                    The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema does not add any such bounds.
                    This means that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
                    have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of the
                    underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Regular expressions">
                <t>
                    Two validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular
                    expressions to express constraints. These regular expressions SHOULD
                    be valid according to the <xref target="ecma262">ECMA 262</xref> regular
                    expression dialect.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support,
                    schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression
                    tokens:

                    <list>
                        <t>individual Unicode characters, as defined by the <xref
                        target="RFC7159">JSON specification</xref>;</t>
                        <t>simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);</t>
                        <t>complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);</t>
                        <t>simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or
                        one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");</t>
                        <t>range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at
                        most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy
                        versions;</t>
                        <t>the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;</t>
                        <t>simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                    Finally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be
                    anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance,
                    the pattern "es" matches "expression".
                </t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section title="General validation considerations">

            <section title="Keywords and instance primitive types">
                <t>
                    Most validation keywords only limit the range of values within a certain primitive type.
                    When the primitive type of the instance is not of the type targeted by the keyword, the
                    validation succeeds.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For example, the "maxLength" keyword will only restrict certain strings (that are too long) from being valid.
                    If the instance is a number, boolean, null, array, or object, the keyword passes validation.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Missing keywords">
                <t>
                    Validation keywords that are missing never restrict validation.
                    In some cases, this no-op behavior is identical to a keyword that exists with certain values,
                    and these values are noted where known.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Linearity">
                <!-- I call this "linear" in the same manner e.g. waves are linear, they don't interact with each other -->
                <t>
                    Validation keywords typically operate independent of each other, without affecting each other.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For author convienence, there are some exceptions:
                    <list>
	                     <t>"additionalProperties", whose behavior is defined in terms of "properties" and "patternProperties"; and</t>
                        <t>"additionalItems", whose behavior is defined in terms of "items"</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section title="Validation keywords">
            <t>
                Validation keywords in a schema impose requirements for successfully validating an instance.
            </t>

            <section title="multipleOf">
                <t>
                    The value of "multipleOf" MUST be a number, strictly greater than 0.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A numeric instance is only valid if division by this keyword's value results in an integer.
                </t>

            <section title="maximum">
            <t>

            </t>
            <t>
                If the instance is a number, then this keyword validates if "exclusiveMaximum" is true and instance is less than the provided value,
                or else if the instance is less than or exactly equal to the provided value.
            </t>

                    An undefined value is the same as false.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If "exclusiveMaximum" is true, then a numeric instance SHOULD NOT be equal to the value specified in "maximum".
                    If "exclusiveMaximum" is false (or not specified), then a numeric instance MAY be equal to the value of "maximum".

                <t>
                    If the instance is a number, then this keyword validates if "exclusiveMinimum" is true and instance is greater than the provided value,
                    or else if the instance is greater than or exactly equal to the provided value.

                <t>
                    If "exclusiveMinimum" is true, then a numeric instance SHOULD NOT be equal to the value specified in "minimum".

                    A string instance is considered valid if the regular

                    Structural validation alone may be insufficient to validate that an instance
                    meets all the requirements of an application. The "format" keyword is defined to
                    allow interoperable semantic validation for a fixed subset of values which are
                    accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external

                <t>
                    The value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A
                    format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If
                    the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this
                    format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.

        <section title="Security considerations">
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and conserns all the security considerations listed there.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous different (often incompatible) implementations.
                Some implementations allow the embedding of arbritrary code, which is outside the scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.
                Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"),
                resulting in a denial-of-service attack.

                This specification does not have any influence with regards to IANA.
