                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is JSON
                instance validation.
                This document specifies a vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON
                documents, provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data, and to make
                assertions about what a valid document must look like.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using
                keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is also defined to assist in interactive user interface instance generation.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification will use the concepts, syntax, and terminology defined
                by the <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema core</xref> specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>
            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are <xref target="json-schema">equal</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Overview">
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation asserts constraints on the structure of instance data.
                An instance location that satisfies all asserted constraints is then
                annotated with any keywords that contain non-assertion information,
                such as descriptive metadata and usage hints.  If all locations within
                the instance satisfy all asserted constraints, then the instance is
                said to be valid against the schema.
            </t>
            <t>
                Each schema object is independently evaluated against each instance location
                to which it applies.  This greatly simplifies the implementation requirements
                for validators by ensuring that they do not need to maintain state across
                the document-wide validation process.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines a set of assertion keywords, as well as a small vocabulary
                of metadata keywords that can be used to annotate the JSON instance with
                useful information.  The <xref target="format" /> and <xref target="content" />
                keywords are also useful as annotations as well as being optional assertions,
                as they convey additional usage guidance for the instance data.
            </t>

        <section title="Interoperability Considerations">

            <section title="Validation of String Instances">
                <t>
                    It should be noted that the nul character (\u0000) is valid in a JSON string. An
                    instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless
                    of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Validation of Numeric Instances">
                <t>
                    The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema
                    does not add any such bounds.
                    This means that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
                    have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of the
                    underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Regular Expressions" anchor="regexInterop">
                <t>
                    Two validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular
                    expressions to express constraints, and the "regex" value for the
                    "format" keyword constrains the instance value to be a regular expression.
                     These regular expressions SHOULD be valid according to the
                    <xref target="ecma262">ECMA 262</xref> regular expression dialect.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support,
                    schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression
                    tokens:

                    <list>
                        <t>individual Unicode characters, as defined by the <xref
                        target="RFC7159">JSON specification</xref>;</t>
                        <t>simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);</t>
                        <t>complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);</t>
                        <t>simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or
                        one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");</t>
                        <t>range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at
                        most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy
                        versions;</t>
                        <t>the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;</t>
                        <t>simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                     Validation rules should make sure they validate the complete input.
                    <list>
                        <t>Validation rules should begin with "^"</t>

                <t>
                    Keywords that use regular expressions, or constrain the instance value
                    to be a regular expression, are subject to the interoperability
                    considerations for regular expressions in the

                This meta-schema describes the core keywords, the subschema application

                SHOULD support the subschema application vocabulary, and MUST NOT

                <t>
                    Structural validation alone may be insufficient to validate that an instance
                    meets all the requirements of an application. The "format" keyword is defined to
                    allow interoperable semantic validation for a fixed subset of values which are
                    accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external
                    specifications.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A
                    format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If
                    the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this
                    format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.

                <t>
                    The "format" keyword functions as both an annotation
                    and as an assertion.  While no special effort is required to
                    implement it as an annotation conveying semantic meaning, implementing
                    validation is non-trivial.

                <t>
                    Implementations MAY support the "format" keyword as a validation assertion.
                    Should they choose to do so:

                </t>

                <t>
                    Implementations MAY add custom format attributes. Save for agreement between
                    parties, schema authors SHALL NOT expect a peer implementation to support this
                    keyword and/or custom format attributes.

                    the document (or the resource it represents), but it will not be included

                    discretion.

                <t>
                    For example, "readOnly" would be used to mark a database-generated serial
                    number as read-only, while "writeOnly" would be used to mark a password

                    input values as they are typed for write-only fields.

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and concerns all
                the security considerations listed there.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous
                different (often incompatible) implementations.
                Some implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is outside the
                scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.
                Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute
                (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"), resulting in a denial-of-service
                attack.
            </t>
            <t>
                Implementations that support validating or otherwise evaluating instance
                string data based on "contentEncoding" and/or "contentMediaType" are at
                risk of evaluating data in an unsafe way based on misleading information.
                Applications can mitigate this risk by only performing such processing
                when a relationship between the schema and instance is established
                (e.g., they share the same authority).
            </t>
            <t>
                Processing a media type or encoding is subject to the security considerations
                of that media type or encoding.  For example, the security considerations
                of <xref target="RFC4329">RFC 4329 Scripting Media Types</xref> apply when
                processing JavaScript or ECMAScript encoded within a JSON string.

        <section title="Keywords Moved from Validation to Core">
            <t>
                Several keywords have been moved from this document into the
                <xref target="json-schema">Core Specification</xref> as of this draft, in some
                cases with re-naming or other changes.  This affects the following former
                validation keywords:
                <list style="hanging">
                    <t hangText='"definitions"'>
                        Renamed to "$defs" to match "$ref" and be shorter to type.
                        Schema vocabulary authors SHOULD NOT define a "definitions" keyword
                        with different behavior in order to avoid invalidating schemas that
                        still use the older name.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText='"allOf", "anyOf", "oneOf", "not", "if", "then", "else",
                                 "items", "additionalItems", "contains", "propertyNames",
                                 "properties", "patternProperties", "additionalProperties"'>
                        All of these keywords apply subschemas to the instance and combine
                        their results, without asserting any conditions of their own.
                        Without assertion keywords, these applicators can only cause assertion
                        failures by using the false boolean schema, or by inverting the result
                        of the true boolean schema.  For this reason, they are better defined
                        as a generic mechanism on which validation, hyper-schema, and extension
                        vocabularies can all be based
                    </t>
                    <t hangText='"dependencies"'>
                        This keyword had two different modes of behavior, which made it
                        relatively challenging to implement and reason about.
                        The schema form has been moved to Core and renamed to
                        "dependentSchemas", as part of the applicator vocabulary.
                        It is analogous to "properties", except that instead of applying
                        its subschema to the property value, it applies it to the object
                        containing the property.
                        The property name array form is retained here and renamed to
                        "dependentRequired", as it is an assertion which is a shortcut
                        for the conditional use of the "required" assertion keyword.
