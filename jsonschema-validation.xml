                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is JSON
                instance validation.
                This document specifies a vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON
                documents, provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data, and to make
                assertions about what a valid document must look like.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using
                keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is also defined to assist in interactive user interface instance generation.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification will use the concepts, syntax, and terminology defined
                by the <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema core</xref> specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>
            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are <xref target="json-schema">equal</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Overview">
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation asserts constraints on the structure of instance data.
                An instance location that satisfies all asserted constraints is then
                annotated with any keywords that contain non-assertion information,
                such as descriptive metadata and usage hints.  If all locations within
                the instance satisfy all asserted constraints, then the instance is
                said to be valid against the schema.
            </t>
            <t>
                Each schema object is independently evaluated against each instance location
                to which it applies.  This greatly simplifies the implementation requirements
                for validators by ensuring that they do not need to maintain state across
                the document-wide validation process.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines a set of assertion keywords, as well as a small vocabulary
                of metadata keywords that can be used to annotate the JSON instance with
                useful information.  The <xref target="format" /> keyword is intended primarily
                as an annotation, but can optionally be used as an assertion.  The
                <xref target="content" /> keywords are annotations for working with documents
                embedded as JSON strings.
            </t>

        <section title="Interoperability Considerations">

            <section title="Validation of String Instances">
                <t>
                    It should be noted that the nul character (\u0000) is valid in a JSON string. An
                    instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless
                    of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Validation of Numeric Instances">
                <t>
                    The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema
                    does not add any such bounds.
                    This means that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
                    have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of the
                    underlying programming language to deal with such data.

                <t>
                    Keywords that use regular expressions, or constrain the instance value
                    to be a regular expression, are subject to the interoperability
                    considerations for regular expressions in the
                    <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema Core</xref> specification.

                For schema author convenience, this meta-schema describes a dialect

                defined in this specification and the JSON Schema Core specification,
                as well as two former keywords which are reserved for a transitional period.
                Individual vocabulary and vocabulary meta-schema URIs are given for
                each section below.  Certain vocabularies are optional to support, which

                Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between

                SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and

                <t>
                    Structural validation alone may be insufficient to allow an application to correctly
                    utilize certain values. The "format" annotation keyword is defined to allow schema
                    authors to convey semantic information for a fixed subset of values which are
                    accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external
                    specifications.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A
                    format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If
                    the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this
                    format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.  All format attributes defined
                    in this section apply to strings, but a format attribute can be specified
                    to apply to any instance types defined in the data model defined in the
                    <xref target="json-schema">core JSON Schema.</xref>
                    <cref>
                        Note that the "type" keyword in this specification defines an "integer" type
                        which is not part of the data model. Therefore a format attribute can be
                        limited to numbers, but not specifically to integers. However, a numeric
                        format can be used alongside the "type" keyword with a value of "integer",
                        or could be explicitly defined to always pass if the number is not an integer,
                        which produces essentially the same behavior as only applying to integers.

                    In addition to the Format-Annotation vocabulary, a secondary vocabulary is available
                    for custom meta-schemas that defines "format" as an assertion. The URI for the
                    Format-Assertion vocabulary, is:
                    &lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/format-assertion&gt;. The current

                    Specifying both the Format-Annotation and the Format-Assertion vocabularies is functionally
                    equivalent to specifying only the Format-Assertion vocabulary since its requirements
                    are a superset of the Format-Annotation vocabulary.

                        evaluation and MUST be disabled by default. Implementations SHOULD document

                            the Format-Assertion vocabulary since implementations are not required to
                            provide full validation support when the Format-Assertion vocabulary

                            <t>
                                MUST still collect "format" as an annotation if the implementation
                                supports annotation collection;
                            </t>
                            <t>
                                MUST evaluate "format" as an assertion;
                            </t>
                            <t>
                                MUST implement syntactic validation for all format attributes defined
                                in this specification, and for any additional format attributes that
                                it recognizes, such that there exist possible instance values
                                of the correct type that will fail validation.
                            </t>
                        </list>
                        The requirement for minimal validation of format attributes is intentionally
                        vague and permissive, due to the complexity involved in many of the attributes.
                        Note in particular that the requirement is limited to syntactic checking; it is
                        not to be expected that an implementation would send an email, attempt to connect
                        to a URL, or otherwise check the existence of an entity identified by a format
                        instance.
                        <cref>
                            The expectation is that for simple formats such as date-time, syntactic
                            validation will be thorough.  For a complex format such as email addresses,
                            which are the amalgamation of various standards and numerous adjustments
                            over time, with obscure and/or obsolete rules that may or may not be
                            restricted by other applications making use of the value, a minimal validation
                            is sufficient.  For example, an instance string that does not contain
                            an "@" is clearly not a valid email address, and an "email" or "hostname"
                            containing characters outside of 7-bit ASCII is likewise clearly invalid.

                    <t>
                        It is RECOMMENDED that implementations use a common parsing library for each format,
                        or a well-known regular expression.  Implementations SHOULD clearly document
                        how and to what degree each format attribute is validated.

                        since by default implementations are not required to support this keyword
                        as an assertion.  Supporting the format vocabulary with a value of true is
                        understood to greatly increase code size and in some cases execution time,
                        and will not be appropriate for all implementations.

                        custom format attributes. An implementation MUST NOT fail to collect unknown formats
                        as annotations.  When the Format-Assertion vocabulary is specified, implementations

                        it is RECOMMENDED to define additional keywords in a custom vocabulary rather than

                    Implementations MAY offer the ability to decode, parse, and/or validate
                    the string contents automatically.  However, it MUST NOT perform these
                    operations by default, and MUST provide the validation result of each
                    string-encoded document separately from the enclosing document.  This
                    process SHOULD be equivalent to fully evaluating the instance against
                    the original schema, followed by using the annotations to decode, parse,

                    If the instance value is a string, this property defines that the string
                    SHOULD be interpreted as encoded binary data and decoded using the encoding
                    named by this property.

                    Possible values indicating base 16, 32, and 64 encodings with several
                    variations are listed in <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>.  Additionally,
                    sections 6.7 and 6.8 of <xref target="RFC2045">RFC 2045</xref> provide
                    encodings used in MIME. This keyword is derived from MIME's
                    Content-Transfer-Encoding header, which was designed to map binary data
                    into ASCII characters.  It is not related to HTTP's Content-Encoding header,
                    which is used to encode (e.g. compress or encrypt)

                <t>
                    As "base64" is defined in both RFCs, the definition
                    from RFC 4648 SHOULD be assumed unless the string is specifically intended
                    for use in a MIME context.  Note that all of these encodings result in
                    strings consisting only of 7-bit ASCII characters.  Therefore, this keyword
                    has no meaning for strings containing characters outside of that range.

                    If this keyword is absent, but "contentMediaType" is present, this
                    indicates that the encoding is the identity encoding, meaning that
                    no transformation was needed in order to represent the content in

                    The value of these keywords MUST be a boolean.  When multiple occurrences
                    of these keywords are applicable to a single sub-instance, the resulting
                    behavior SHOULD be as for a true value if any occurrence specifies a true value,
                    and SHOULD be as for a false value otherwise.

                <t>
                    If "readOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value
                    of the instance is managed exclusively by the owning authority, and
                    attempts by an application to modify the value of this property are
                    expected to be ignored or rejected by that owning authority.

                    An instance document that is marked as "readOnly" for the entire document

                    error, at the authority's discretion.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If "writeOnly" has a value of boolean true, it indicates that the value
                    is never present when the instance is retrieved from the owning authority.
                    It can be present when sent to the owning authority to update or create
                    the document (or the resource it represents), but it will not be included
                    in any updated or newly created version of the instance.

                    An instance document that is marked as "writeOnly" for the entire document
                    MAY be returned as a blank document of some sort, or MAY produce an error
                    upon retrieval, or have the retrieval request ignored, at the authority's
                    discretion.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For example, "readOnly" would be used to mark a database-generated serial
                    number as read-only, while "writeOnly" would be used to mark a password
                    input field.

                    These keywords can be used to assist in user interface instance generation.

                    input values as they are typed for write-only fields.

            <t>
                JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and concerns all
                the security considerations listed there.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous
                different (often incompatible) implementations.
                Some implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is outside the
                scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.
                Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute
                (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"), resulting in a denial-of-service
                attack.
            </t>
            <t>
                Implementations that support validating or otherwise evaluating instance
                string data based on "contentEncoding" and/or "contentMediaType" are at
                risk of evaluating data in an unsafe way based on misleading information.
                Applications can mitigate this risk by only performing such processing
                when a relationship between the schema and instance is established
                (e.g., they share the same authority).
            </t>
            <t>
                Processing a media type or encoding is subject to the security considerations
                of that media type or encoding.  For example, the security considerations
                of <xref target="RFC4329">RFC 4329 Scripting Media Types</xref> apply when
                processing JavaScript or ECMAScript encoded within a JSON string.

        <section title="Keywords Moved from Validation to Core">
            <t>
                Several keywords have been moved from this document into the
                <xref target="json-schema">Core Specification</xref> as of this draft, in some
                cases with re-naming or other changes.  This affects the following former
                validation keywords:
                <list style="hanging">
                    <t hangText='"definitions"'>
                        Renamed to "$defs" to match "$ref" and be shorter to type.
                        Schema vocabulary authors SHOULD NOT define a "definitions" keyword
                        with different behavior in order to avoid invalidating schemas that
                        still use the older name.  While "definitions" is absent in the
                        single-vocabulary meta-schemas referenced by this document, it
                        remains present in the default meta-schema, and implementations
                        SHOULD assume that "$defs" and "definitions" have the same
                        behavior when that meta-schema is used.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText='"allOf", "anyOf", "oneOf", "not", "if", "then", "else",
                                 "items", "additionalItems", "contains", "propertyNames",
                                 "properties", "patternProperties", "additionalProperties"'>
                        All of these keywords apply subschemas to the instance and combine
                        their results, without asserting any conditions of their own.
                        Without assertion keywords, these applicators can only cause assertion
                        failures by using the false boolean schema, or by inverting the result
                        of the true boolean schema (or equivalent schema objects).
                        For this reason, they are better defined as a generic mechanism on which
                        validation, hyper-schema, and extension vocabularies can all be based.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText='"dependencies"'>
                        This keyword had two different modes of behavior, which made it
                        relatively challenging to implement and reason about.
                        The schema form has been moved to Core and renamed to
                        "dependentSchemas", as part of the applicator vocabulary.
                        It is analogous to "properties", except that instead of applying
                        its subschema to the property value, it applies it to the object
                        containing the property.
                        The property name array form is retained here and renamed to
                        "dependentRequired", as it is an assertion which is a shortcut
                        for the conditional use of the "required" assertion keyword.
