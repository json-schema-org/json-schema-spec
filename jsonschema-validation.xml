                JSON Schema (application/schema+json) has several purposes, one of which is JSON instance validation.
                This document specifies a vocabulary for JSON Schema to describe the meaning of JSON documents,
                provide hints for user interfaces working with JSON data,
                and to make assertions about what a valid document must look like.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be used to require that a given JSON document (an instance)
                satisfies a certain number of criteria. These criteria are asserted by using
                keywords described in this specification. In addition, a set of keywords
                is also defined to assist in interactive user interface instance generation.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification will use the terminology defined by the
                <xref target="json-schema">JSON Schema core</xref> specification.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
            <t>
                <!-- The text in this section has been copied from the official boilerplate,
                and should not be modified.-->

                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
                "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification uses the term "container instance" to refer to both array and
                object instances. It uses the term "children instances" to refer to array elements
                or object member values.
            </t>
            <t>
                Elements in an array value are said to be unique if no two elements of this array
                are <xref target="json-schema">equal</xref>.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability considerations">

            <section title="Validation of string instances">
                <t>
                    It should be noted that the nul character (\u0000) is valid in a JSON string. An
                    instance to validate may contain a string value with this character, regardless
                    of the ability of the underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Validation of numeric instances">
                <t>
                    The JSON specification allows numbers with arbitrary precision, and JSON Schema does not add any such bounds.
                    This means that numeric instances processed by JSON Schema can be arbitrarily large and/or
                    have an arbitrarily long decimal part, regardless of the ability of the
                    underlying programming language to deal with such data.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Regular expressions">
                <t>
                    Two validation keywords, "pattern" and "patternProperties", use regular
                    expressions to express constraints. These regular expressions SHOULD
                    be valid according to the <xref target="ecma262">ECMA 262</xref> regular
                    expression dialect.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support,
                    schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression
                    tokens:

                    <list>
                        <t>individual Unicode characters, as defined by the <xref
                        target="RFC7159">JSON specification</xref>;</t>
                        <t>simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);</t>
                        <t>complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);</t>
                        <t>simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?" (zero or
                        one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");</t>
                        <t>range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at least x, at
                        most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy
                        versions;</t>
                        <t>the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;</t>
                        <t>simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>
                    Finally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be
                    anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance,
                    the pattern "es" matches "expression".
                </t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section title="General validation considerations">

            <section title="Keywords and instance primitive types">
                <t>
                    Most validation keywords only constrain values within a certain primitive type.
                    When the type of the instance is not of the type targeted by the keyword, the
                    validation succeeds.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For example, the "maxLength" keyword will only restrict certain strings (that are too long) from being valid.
                    If the instance is a number, boolean, null, array, or object, the keyword passes validation.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Validation of primitive types and child values">
                <t>
                    Two of the primitive types, array and object, allow for child values.
                    The validation of the primitive type is considered separately from
                    the validation of child instances.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For arrays, primitive type validation consists of validating
                    restrictions on length with "minItems" and "maxItems", while
                    "items" and "additionalItems" determine which subschemas apply
                    to which elements of the array.  In addition, "uniqueItems"
                    and "contains" validate array contents as a whole.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For objects, primitive type validation consists of validating
                    restrictions on which and how many properties appear with
                    "required", "minProperties", "maxProperties", "propertyNames",
                    and the string array form of "dependencies", while "properties",
                    "patternProperties", and "additionalProperties" determine which
                    subschemas apply to which object property values.
                    In addition, the schema form of "dependencies" validates the
                    object as a whole based on the presence of specific property names.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Constraints and missing keywords">
                <t>
                    Each JSON Schema validation keyword adds constraints that
                    an instance must satisfy in order to successfully validate.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Validation keywords that are missing never restrict validation.
                    In some cases, this no-op behavior is identical to a keyword that exists with certain values,
                    and these values are noted where known.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Keyword independence">
                <t>
                    Validation keywords typically operate independently, without
                    affecting each other's outcomes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For schema author convenience, there are some exceptions:
                    <list>
                        <t>"additionalProperties", whose behavior is defined in terms of "properties" and "patternProperties"; and</t>
                        <t>"additionalItems", whose behavior is defined in terms of "items".</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
            </section>

                    RECOMMENDED that these values be valid against the associated schema.

                    MAY still be used in this manner.

        <section title='Semantic validation with "format"'>

            <section title="Foreword">
                <t>
                    Structural validation alone may be insufficient to validate that an instance
                    meets all the requirements of an application. The "format" keyword is defined to
                    allow interoperable semantic validation for a fixed subset of values which are
                    accurately described by authoritative resources, be they RFCs or other external
                    specifications.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The value of this keyword is called a format attribute. It MUST be a string. A
                    format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If
                    the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this
                    format attribute and instance SHOULD succeed.
                </t>

            </section>

            <section title="Implementation requirements">
                <t>
                    Implementations MAY support the "format" keyword. Should they choose to do so:

                    <list>
                        <t>they SHOULD implement validation for attributes defined below;</t>
                        <t>they SHOULD offer an option to disable validation for this keyword.</t>
                    </list>

                </t>

                <t>
                    Implementations MAY add custom format attributes. Save for agreement between
                    parties, schema authors SHALL NOT expect a peer implementation to support this
                    keyword and/or custom format attributes.

            <t>
                JSON Schema validation defines a vocabulary for JSON Schema core and concerns all the security considerations listed there.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema validation allows the use of Regular Expressions, which have numerous different (often incompatible) implementations.
                Some implementations allow the embedding of arbitrary code, which is outside the scope of JSON Schema and MUST NOT be permitted.
                Regular expressions can often also be crafted to be extremely expensive to compute (with so-called "catastrophic backtracking"),
                resulting in a denial-of-service attack.
