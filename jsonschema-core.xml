                JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON-based format
                for describing the structure of JSON data.
                JSON Schema asserts what a JSON document must look like,
                ways to extract information from it,
                and how to interact with it.
                The "application/schema-instance+json" media type provides additional
                feature-rich integration with "application/schema+json" beyond what can be offered
                for "application/json" documents.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema
                is intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and interaction
                control of JSON data.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines JSON Schema core terminology and mechanisms, including
                pointing to another JSON Schema by reference,
                dereferencing a JSON Schema reference,
                specifying the dialect being used,
                specifying a dialect's vocabulary requirements,
                and defining the expected output.
            </t>
            <t>
                Other specifications define the vocabularies that perform assertions about validation,
                linking, annotation, navigation, and interaction.
            </t>

                interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

                be interpreted as defined in <xref target="RFC8259">RFC 8259</xref>.

        </section>

        <section title="Overview">
            <t>
                This document proposes a new media type "application/schema+json" to identify a JSON
                Schema for describing JSON data.
                It also proposes a further optional media type, "application/schema-instance+json",
                to provide additional integration features.
                JSON Schemas are themselves JSON documents.
                This, and related specifications, define keywords allowing authors to describe JSON
                data in several ways.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema uses keywords to assert constraints on JSON instances or annotate those
                instances with additional information.  Additional keywords are used to apply
                assertions and annotations to more complex JSON data structures, or based on
                some sort of condition.
            </t>
            <t>
                To facilitate re-use, keywords can be organized into vocabularies. A vocabulary
                consists of a list of keywords, together with their syntax and semantics.
                A dialect is defined as a set of vocabularies and their required support
                identified in a meta-schema.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Schema can be extended either by defining additional vocabularies,
                or less formally by defining additional keywords outside of any vocabulary.
                Unrecognized individual keywords simply have their values collected as annotations,
                while the behavior with respect to an unrecognized vocabulary can be controlled
                when declaring which vocabularies are in use.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document defines a core vocabulary that MUST be supported by any
                implementation, and cannot be disabled.  Its keywords are each prefixed
                with a "$" character to emphasize their required nature.  This vocabulary
                is essential to the functioning of the "application/schema+json" media
                type, and is used to bootstrap the loading of other vocabularies.
            </t>
            <t>
                Additionally, this document defines a RECOMMENDED vocabulary of keywords
                for applying subschemas conditionally, and for applying subschemas to
                the contents of objects and arrays.  Either this vocabulary or one very
                much like it is required to write schemas for non-trivial JSON instances,
                whether those schemas are intended for assertion validation, annotation,
                or both.  While not part of the required core vocabulary, for maximum
                interoperability this additional vocabulary is included in this document
                and its use is strongly encouraged.
            </t>
            <t>
                Further vocabularies for purposes such as structural validation or
                hypermedia annotation are defined in other documents.  These other
                documents each define a dialect collecting the standard sets of
                vocabularies needed to write schemas for that document's purpose.

        <section title="Definitions">

            <section title="JSON Document">
                <t>
                    A JSON document is an information resource (series of octets) described by the
                    application/json media type.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In JSON Schema, the terms "JSON document", "JSON text", and "JSON value" are
                    interchangeable because of the data model it defines.
                </t>
                <t>
                    JSON Schema is only defined over JSON documents. However, any document or memory
                    structure that can be parsed into or processed according to the JSON Schema data
                    model can be interpreted against a JSON Schema, including media types like
                    <xref target="RFC7049">CBOR</xref>.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Instance">
                <t>
                    A JSON document to which a schema is applied is known as an "instance".
                </t>
                <t>
                    JSON Schema is defined over "application/json" or compatible documents,
                    including media types with the "+json" structured syntax suffix.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Among these, this specification defines the "application/schema-instance+json"
                    media type which defines handling for fragments in the IRI.
                </t>

                <section title="Instance Data Model">
                    <t>
                        JSON Schema interprets documents according to a data model. A JSON value
                        interpreted according to this data model is called an "instance".
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An instance has one of six primitive types, and a range of possible values
                        depending on the type:

                        <list style="hanging">
                            <t hangText="null:">A JSON "null" value</t>
                            <t hangText="boolean:">A "true" or "false" value, from the JSON "true" or "false" value</t>
                            <t hangText="object:">An unordered set of properties mapping a string to an instance, from the JSON "object" value</t>
                            <t hangText="array:">An ordered list of instances, from the JSON "array" value</t>
                            <t hangText="number:">An arbitrary-precision, base-10 decimal number value, from the JSON "number" value</t>
                            <t hangText="string:">A string of Unicode code points, from the JSON "string" value</t>
                        </list>
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Whitespace and formatting concerns, including different lexical
                        representations of numbers that are equal within the data model, are thus
                        outside the scope of JSON Schema.  JSON Schema
                        <xref target="vocabulary">vocabularies</xref> that wish
                        to work with such differences in lexical representations SHOULD define
                        keywords to precisely interpret formatted strings within the data model
                        rather than relying on having the original JSON representation Unicode
                        characters available.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Since an object cannot have two properties with the same key, behavior for a
                        JSON document that tries to define two properties with
                        the same key in a single object is undefined.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Note that JSON Schema vocabularies are free to define their own extended
                        type system.  This should not be confused with the core data model types
                        defined here.  As an example, "integer" is a reasonable type for a
                        vocabulary to define as a value for a keyword, but the data model
                        makes no distinction between integers and other numbers.
                    </t>
                </section>

                <section title="Instance Equality">
                    <t>
                        Two JSON instances are said to be equal if and only if they are of the same type
                        and have the same value according to the data model. Specifically, this means:

                        <list>
                            <t>both are null; or</t>

                            <t>both are false; or</t>
                            <t>both are strings, and are the same codepoint-for-codepoint; or</t>
                            <t>both are numbers, and have the same mathematical value; or</t>

                                value.</t>

                        Implied in this definition is that arrays must be the same length,
                        objects must have the same number of members,
                        properties in objects are unordered,
                        there is no way to define multiple properties with the same key,
                        and mere formatting differences (indentation, placement of commas, trailing
                        zeros) are insignificant.

                        In this case, annotations still apply; but most validation keywords will not be useful,

                    A JSON Schema document, or simply a schema, is a JSON document used to describe
                    an instance.
                    A schema can itself be interpreted as an instance, but SHOULD always be given
                    the media type "application/schema+json" rather than
                    "application/schema-instance+json".  The "application/schema+json" media
                    type is defined to offer a superset of the
                    fragment identifier syntax and semantics provided by

                        A schema vocabulary, or simply a vocabulary, is a set of keywords,
                        their syntax, and their semantics.  A vocabulary is generally organized
                        around a particular purpose.  Different uses of JSON Schema, such
                        as validation, hypermedia, or user interface generation, will
                        involve different sets of vocabularies.

                    <t>
                        Vocabularies are the primary unit of re-use in JSON Schema, as schema
                        authors can indicate what vocabularies are required or optional in
                        order to process the schema.  Since vocabularies are identified by IRIs
                        in the meta-schema, generic implementations can load extensions to support
                        previously unknown vocabularies.  While keywords can be supported outside
                        of any vocabulary, there is no analogous mechanism to indicate individual
                        keyword usage.

                        A schema that itself describes a schema is called a meta-schema.
                        Meta-schemas are used to validate JSON Schemas and specify which vocabularies
                        they are using.

                        schemas that conform to the syntax of those vocabularies.  However, meta-schemas
                        and vocabularies are separate in order to allow meta-schemas to validate
                        schema conformance more strictly or more loosely than the vocabularies'
                        specifications call for.  Meta-schemas may also describe and validate
                        additional keywords that are not part of a formal vocabulary.

                JSON Schema keywords fall into several general behavior categories.
                Assertions validate that an instance satisfies constraints, producing
                a boolean result.  Annotations attach information that applications
                may use in any way they see fit.
                Applicators apply subschemas to parts of the instance and combine
                their results.

            <t>
                Extension keywords SHOULD stay within these categories, keeping in mind
                that annotations in particular are extremely flexible.  Complex behavior
                is usually better delegated to applications on the basis of annotation
                data than implemented directly as schema keywords.  However, extension
                keywords MAY define other behaviors for specialized purposes.

                Evaluating an instance against a schema involves processing all of the
                keywords in the schema against the appropriate locations within the instance.
                Typically, applicator keywords are processed until a schema object with no
                applicators (and therefore no subschemas) is reached.  The appropriate
                location in the instance is evaluated against the assertion and
                annotation keywords in the schema object, and their results are gathered
                into the parent schema according to the rules of the applicator.
            </t>
            <t>
                Evaluation of a parent schema object can complete once all of its
                subschemas have been evaluated, although in some circumstances evaluation
                may be short-circuited due to assertion results.  When annotations are
                being collected, some assertion result short-circuiting is not possible
                due to the need to examine all subschemas for annotation collection, including
                those that cannot further change the assertion result.

                    While most JSON Schema keywords can be evaluated on their own,
                    or at most need to take into account the values or results of
                    adjacent keywords in the same schema object, a few have more
                    complex behavior.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The lexical scope of a keyword is determined by the nested JSON
                    data structure of objects and arrays.  The largest such scope
                    is an entire schema document.  The smallest scope is a single
                    schema object with no subschemas.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Keywords MAY be defined with a partial value, such as a IRI-reference,
                    which must be resolved against another value, such as another
                    IRI-reference or a full IRI, which is found through the lexical
                    structure of the JSON document.  The "$id", "$ref", and
                    "$dynamicRef" core keywords, and the "base" JSON Hyper-Schema
                    keyword, are examples of this sort of behavior.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Note that some keywords, such as "$schema", apply to the lexical
                    scope of the entire schema resource, and therefore MUST only
                    appear in a schema resource's root schema.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Other keywords may take into account the dynamic scope that
                    exists during the evaluation of a schema, typically together
                    with an instance document.
                    The outermost dynamic scope is the schema object at
                    which processing begins, even if it is not a schema resource root.
                    The path from this root schema to any particular keyword (that
                    includes any "$ref" and "$dynamicRef" keywords that may have
                    been resolved) is considered the keyword's "validation path."
                </t>
                <t>
                    Lexical and dynamic scopes align until a reference keyword
                    is encountered.  While following the reference keyword moves processing
                    from one lexical scope into a different one, from the perspective
                    of dynamic scope, following a reference is no different from descending
                    into a subschema present as a value.  A keyword on the far side of
                    that reference that resolves information through the dynamic scope
                    will consider the originating side of the reference to be their
                    dynamic parent, rather than examining the local lexically enclosing parent.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The concept of dynamic scope is primarily used with "$dynamicRef" and
                    "$dynamicAnchor", and should be considered an advanced feature
                    and used with caution when defining additional keywords.  It also appears
                    when reporting errors and collected annotations, as it may be possible
                    to revisit the same lexical scope repeatedly with different dynamic
                    scopes.  In such cases, it is important to inform the user of the
                    dynamic path that produced the error or annotation.

                    A missing keyword MUST NOT produce a false assertion result, MUST
                    NOT produce annotation results, and MUST NOT cause any other schema
                    to be evaluated as part of its own behavioral definition.
                    However, given that missing keywords do not contribute annotations,
                    the lack of annotation results may indirectly change the behavior
                    of other keywords.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In some cases, the missing keyword assertion behavior of a keyword is
                    identical to that produced by a certain value, and keyword definitions
                    SHOULD note such values where known.  However, even if the value which
                    produces the default behavior would produce annotation results if
                    present, the default behavior still MUST NOT result in annotations.

                <t>
                    Because annotation collection can add significant cost in terms of both
                    computation and memory, implementations MAY opt out of this feature.
                    Keywords that are specified in terms of collected annotations SHOULD
                    describe reasonable alternate approaches when appropriate.
                    This approach is demonstrated by the
                    "<xref target="items" format="title"/>" and
                    "<xref target="additionalProperties" format="title"/>" keywords in this

                    Note that when no such alternate approach is possible for a keyword,
                    implementations that do not support annotation collections will not
                    be able to support those keywords or vocabularies that contain them.

                    Applicators allow for building more complex schemas than can be accomplished

                    <xref target="schema-document">schema document</xref> begins by applying
                    the <xref target="root">root schema</xref> to the complete instance
                    document.  From there, keywords known as applicators are used to determine
                    which additional schemas are applied.  Such schemas may be applied in-place
                    to the current location, or to a child location.

                    a schema elsewhere in the same schema document, or in a different one.
                    The mechanism for identifying such referenced schemas is defined by the

                        targeted by the keyword, the instance is considered to conform
                        to the assertion.

                    JSON Schema can annotate an instance with information, whenever the instance
                    validates against the schema object containing the annotation, and all of its
                    parent schema objects.  The information can be a simple value, or can be
                    calculated based on the instance contents.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Annotations are attached to specific locations in an instance.
                    Since many subschemas can be applied to any single
                    location, applications may need to decide how to handle differing
                    annotation values being attached to the same instance location by
                    the same schema keyword in different schema objects.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Unlike assertion results, annotation data can take a wide variety of forms,
                    which are provided to applications to use as they see fit.  JSON Schema
                    implementations are not expected to make use of the collected information
                    on behalf of applications.

                <t>
                    Unless otherwise specified, the value of an annotation keyword
                    is the keyword's value.  However, other behaviors are possible.
                    For example, <xref target="json-hyper-schema">JSON Hyper-Schema's</xref>
                    "links" keyword is a complex annotation that produces a value based
                    in part on the instance data.
                </t>
                <t>
                    While "short-circuit" evaluation is possible for assertions, collecting
                    annotations requires examining all schemas that apply to an instance
                    location, even if they cannot change the overall assertion result.
                    The only exception is that subschemas of a schema object that has

                        Annotations are collected by keywords that explicitly define
                        annotation-collecting behavior.  Note that boolean schemas cannot
                        produce annotations as they do not make use of keywords.

                    <t>
                        A collected annotation MUST include the following information:

                                The schema location path, indicating how reference keywords
                                such as "$ref" were followed to reach the absolute schema location.

                            Applications MAY make decisions on which of multiple annotation values
                            to use based on the schema location that contributed the value.

                            In this example, both Feature A and Feature B make use of the re-usable
                            "enabledToggle" schema.  That schema uses the "title", "description",
                            and "default" annotations.  Therefore the application has to decide how
                            to handle the additional "default" value for Feature A, and the additional
                            "description" value for Feature B.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            The application programmer and the schema author need to agree on the
                            usage.  For this example, let's assume that they agree that the most
                            specific "default" value will be used, and any additional, more generic
                            "default" values will be silently ignored.  Let's also assume that they
                            agree that all "description" text is to be used, starting with the most
                            generic, and ending with the most specific.  This requires the schema
                            author to write descriptions that work when combined in this way.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            The application can use the schema location path to determine which
                            values are which.  The values in the feature's immediate "enabled"
                            property schema are more specific, while the values under the re-usable
                            schema that is referenced to with "$ref" are more generic.  The schema
                            location path will show whether each value was found by crossing a
                            "$ref" or not.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Feature A will therefore use a default value of true, while Feature B
                            will use the generic default value of null.  Feature A will only
                            have the generic description from the "enabledToggle" schema, while
                            Feature B will use that description, and also append its locally
                            defined description that explains how to interpret a null value.

                            might take.  For example, an application may consider the presence of
                            two different values for "default" to be an error, regardless of their
                            schema locations.

                Keywords declared in this section, which all begin with "$", make up

                order to process any schema or meta-schema, including those split across
                multiple documents, or exist to reserve keywords for purposes that
                require guaranteed interoperability.
            </t>
            <t>
                The Core vocabulary MUST be considered mandatory at all times, in order
                to bootstrap the processing of further vocabularies.  Meta-schemas
                that use the <xref target="vocabulary">"$vocabulary"</xref> keyword
                to declare the vocabularies in use MUST explicitly list the Core vocabulary,

                The behavior of a false value for this vocabulary (and only this

                is RECOMMENDED that implementations detect these cases and raise
                an error when they occur.  It is not meaningful to declare that
                a meta-schema optionally uses Core.

            <t>
                Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" MUST be considered to

                While the "$" prefix is not formally reserved for the Core vocabulary,
                it is RECOMMENDED that extension keywords (in vocabularies or otherwise)
                begin with a character other than "$" to avoid possible future collisions.

                    Two concepts, meta-schemas and vocabularies, are used to inform an implementation
                    how to interpret a schema.  Every schema has a meta-schema, which can be declared

                            to that meta-schema.  Vocabularies define keyword semantics,

                    to impose additional constraints such as forbidding certain keywords, or
                    performing unusually strict syntactical validation, as might be done
                    during a development and testing cycle.  Each vocabulary typically identifies
                    a meta-schema consisting only of the vocabulary's keywords.

                        The "$vocabulary" keyword is used in meta-schemas to identify the
                        vocabularies available for use in schemas described by that meta-schema.
                        It is also used to indicate whether each vocabulary is required or optional,
                        in the sense that an implementation MUST understand the required vocabularies
                        in order to successfully process the schema. Together, this information forms
                        a dialect. Any vocabulary that is understood by the implementation MUST be
                        processed in a manner consistent with the semantic definitions contained
                        within the vocabulary.

                    <t>
                        The value of this keyword MUST be an object.  The property names in the
                        object MUST be IRIs (containing a scheme) and this IRI MUST be normalized.
                        Each IRI that appears as a property name identifies a specific set of
                        keywords and their semantics.

                    <t>
                        The IRI MAY be a URL, but the nature of the retrievable resource is
                        currently undefined, and reserved for future use.  Vocabulary authors
                        MAY use the URL of the vocabulary specification, in a human-readable
                        media type such as text/html or text/plain, as the vocabulary IRI.

                            Vocabulary documents may be added in forthcoming drafts.
                            For now, identifying the keyword set is deemed sufficient as that,
                            along with meta-schema validation, is how the current "vocabularies"
                            work today.  Any future vocabulary document format will be specified
                            as a JSON document, so using text/html or other non-JSON formats
                            in the meantime will not produce any future ambiguity.

                        the vocabulary MUST refuse to process any schemas that declare
                        this meta-schema with "$schema".  If the value is false, implementations
                        that do not recognize the vocabulary SHOULD proceed with processing
                        such schemas.  The value has no impact if the implementation

                        This remains the case for keywords defined
                        by unrecognized vocabularies.  It is not currently possible to distinguish

                        The "$vocabulary" keyword MUST be ignored in schema documents that
                        are not being processed as a meta-schema.  This allows validating
                        a meta-schema M against its own meta-schema M' without requiring
                        the validator to understand the vocabularies declared by M.

                            IRI value of the referring schema's "$schema" keyword.
                            This is how behavior (such as Hyper-Schema usage) has been
                            recognized prior to the existence of vocabularies.

                            If the implementation
                            proceeds with processing the schema, it MUST assume the use of the

                            similar keywords do not automatically inherit the vocabulary

                            must be repeated in the root of each schema document intended

                        Using JSON Pointer fragments requires knowledge of the structure of the schema.
                        When writing schema documents with the intention to provide re-usable
                        schemas, it may be preferable to use a plain name fragment that is not tied to
                        any particular structural location.  This allows a subschema to be relocated
                        without requiring JSON Pointer references to be updated.

                        The "$anchor" and "$dynamicAnchor" keywords are used to specify such
                        fragments.  They are identifier keywords that can only be used to create
                        plain name fragments, rather than absolute IRIs as seen with "$id".

                    <t>
                        The base IRI to which the resulting fragment is appended is the canonical
                        IRI of the schema resource containing the "$anchor" or "$dynamicAnchor"
                        in question.  As discussed in the previous section, this is either the
                        nearest "$id" in the same or parent schema object, 
                        or the base IRI for the document as determined according to 
                        <xref target="RFC3987">RFC 3987</xref> and

                        Separately from the usual usage of IRIs, "$dynamicAnchor"
                        indicates that the fragment is an extension point when used with
                        the "$dynamicRef" keyword.  This low-level, advanced feature
                        makes it easier to extend recursive schemas such as the meta-schemas,
                        without imposing any particular semantics on that extension.

                        In most cases, the normal fragment behavior both suffices and
                        is more intuitive.  Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that "$anchor"
                        be used to create plain name fragments unless there is a clear

                        Several keywords can be used to reference a schema which is to be applied to the
                        current instance location. "$ref" and "$dynamicRef" are applicator
                        keywords, applying the referenced schema to the instance.

                        the possibility to externalise or divide a schema across multiple files,

                        address if it is a network-addressable URL, and implementations SHOULD NOT
                        assume they should perform a network operation when they encounter
                        a network-addressable IRI.

                    If the resulting IRI identifies a schema within the current document, or
                    within another schema document that has been made available to the implementation,
                    then that schema SHOULD be used automatically.

                    When an implementation encounters the &lt;#/$defs/single&gt; schema,
                    it resolves the "$anchor" value as a fragment name against the current
                    base IRI to form &lt;https://example.net/root.json#item&gt;.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When an implementation then looks inside the &lt;#/items&gt; schema, it
                    encounters the &lt;#item&gt; reference, and resolves this to
                    &lt;https://example.net/root.json#item&gt;, which it has seen defined in
                    this same document and can therefore use automatically.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When an implementation encounters the reference to "other.json", it resolves
                    this to &lt;https://example.net/other.json&gt;, which is not defined in this
                    document.  If a schema with that identifier has otherwise been supplied to
                    the implementation, it can also be used automatically.
                    <cref>
                        What should implementations do when the referenced schema is not known?
                        Are there circumstances in which automatic network dereferencing is
                        allowed?  A same origin policy?  A user-configurable option?  In the
                        case of an evolving API described by Hyper-Schema, it is expected that
                        new schemas will be added to the system dynamically, so placing an
                        absolute requirement of pre-loading schema documents is not feasible.

                            the embedded resource.  The canonical IRI of that schema, however,
                            is "https://example.com/bar#/additionalProperties".

                        functioning similarly to a retrieval IRI for a resource.  While valid,
                        examining the resolved value and either using the "$id" (if the value
                        is a subschema), or resolving the reference and using the "$id" of the
                        reference target, is preferable.

                        An implementation MAY choose not to support addressing schemas

                        use canonical IRIs, as using non-canonical IRIs may reduce
                        schema interoperability.

                            This is to avoid requiring implementations to keep track of a whole

                            given that all but one will be fragile if the schema resources
                            are reorganized.  Some have argued that this is easy so there is
                            no point in forbidding it, while others have argued that it complicates
                            schema identification and should be forbidden.  Feedback on this

                    A Compound Schema Document is defined as a JSON document (sometimes called a "bundled" schema)
                    which has multiple embedded JSON Schema Resources bundled into the same document to
                    ease transportation.

                <t>
                    Each embedded Schema Resource MUST be treated as an individual Schema Resource, following standard
                    schema loading and processing requirements, including determining vocabulary support.

                    <t>
                        The bundling process for creating a Compound Schema Document is defined as taking
                        references (such as "$ref") to an external Schema Resource and embedding the referenced
                        Schema Resources within the referring document. Bundling SHOULD be done in such a way that
                        all IRIs (used for referencing) in the base document and any referenced/embedded
                        documents do not require altering.

                    <t>
                        Each embedded JSON Schema Resource MUST identify itself with a IRI using the "$id" keyword,
                        and SHOULD make use of the "$schema" keyword to identify the dialect it is using, in the root of the
                        schema resource. It is RECOMMENDED that the IRI identifier value of "$id" be an Absolute IRI.

                        When the Schema Resource referenced by a by-reference applicator is bundled, it is RECOMMENDED that
                        the Schema Resource be located as a value of a "$defs" object at the containing schema's root.
                        The key of the "$defs" for the now embedded Schema Resource MAY be the "$id" of the bundled schema
                        or some other form of application defined unique identifer (such as a UUID). This key is not
                        intended to be referenced in JSON Schema, but may be used by an application to aid the
                        bundling process.

                    <t>
                        A Schema Resource MAY be embedded in a location other than "$defs" where the location is defined
                        as a schema value.

                        A Bundled Schema Resource MUST NOT be bundled by replacing the schema object from which it was
                        referenced, or by wrapping the Schema Resource in other applicator keywords.

                        In order to produce identical output, references in the containing schema document to the
                        previously external Schema Resources MUST NOT be changed, and now resolve to a schema using the
                        "$id" of an embedded Schema Resource. Such identical output includes validation evaluation and IRIs
                        or paths used in resulting annotations or errors.

                        While the bundling process will often be the main method for creating a Compound Schema Document,

                        Schema Resources existing on their own previously.

                        is undefined.  Similarly, a reference target under a known keyword,
                        for which the value is known not to be a schema, results in undefined
                        behavior in order to avoid burdening implementations with the need

                            Therefore, interpreting it as such has security implications

                        semantics to "$defs" do not allow for any intervening "$id" keywords,
                        and therefore will behave correctly under implementations that attempt
                        to use any reference target as a schema.  However, this behavior is
                        implementation-specific and MUST NOT be relied upon for interoperability.

                            It is RECOMMENDED that instances described by a schema provide a link to
                            a downloadable JSON Schema using the link relation "describedby", as defined by

                            <xref target="RFC7231">HTTP</xref> is frequently the protocol of choice for

                            necessary, when it's instead possible to cache a schema for a long period of
                            time.

                        <t>
                            HTTP servers SHOULD set long-lived caching headers on JSON Schemas.
                            HTTP clients SHOULD observe caching headers and not re-request documents within
                            their freshness period.
                            Distributed systems SHOULD make use of a shared cache and/or caching proxy.

                        <t>
                            Clients SHOULD set or prepend a User-Agent header specific to the JSON Schema
                            implementation or software product. Since symbols are listed in decreasing order
                            of significance, the JSON Schema library name/version should precede the more
                            generic HTTP library name (if any). For example:

        <section title="A Vocabulary for Applying Subschemas">
            <t>
                This section defines a vocabulary of applicator keywords that
                are RECOMMENDED for use as the basis of other vocabularies.
            </t>
            <t>
                Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
                require this vocabulary as if its IRI were present with a value of true.
            </t>
            <t>
                The current IRI for this vocabulary, known as the Applicator vocabulary, is:
                &lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/next/vocab/applicator&gt;.
            </t>
            <t>
                The current IRI for the corresponding meta-schema is:
                <eref target="https://json-schema.org/draft/next/meta/applicator"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                Updated vocabulary and meta-schema IRIs MAY be published between
                specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
                SHOULD consider IRIs dated after this specification draft and
                before the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics
                as those listed here.

            <section title="Keyword Independence">
                <t>
                    Schema keywords typically operate independently, without

                <t>
                    For schema author convenience, there are some exceptions among the

                    These keywords apply subschemas to the same location in the instance
                    as the parent schema is being applied.  They allow combining
                    or modifying the subschema results in various ways.

                <t>
                    Subschemas of these keywords evaluate the instance completely independently
                    such that the results of one such subschema MUST NOT impact the results of sibling
                    subschemas.  Therefore subschemas may be applied in
                    any order.

                        impact on annotation collection, although they enable the same annotation
                        keyword to be applied to an instance location with different values.
                        Annotation keywords define their own rules for combining such values.

                            does not constrain the length of the array.  If the array is longer

            </t>
            <t>
                These instance items or properties may have been unsuccessfully evaluated
                against one or more adjacent keyword subschemas, such as when an assertion
                in a branch of an "anyOf" fails.  Such failed evaluations are not considered
                to contribute to whether or not the item or property has been evaluated.
                Only successful evaluations are considered.
            </t>
            <t>
                If an item in an array or an object property is "successfully evaluated", it
                is logically considered to be valid in terms of the representation of the
                object or array that's expected. For example if a subschema represents a car,
                which requires between 2-4 wheels, and the value of "wheels" is 6, the instance
                object is not "evaluated" to be a car, and the "wheels" property is considered
                "unevaluated (successfully as a known thing)", and does not retain any annotations.
            </t>
            <t>
                Recall that adjacent keywords are keywords within the same schema object,
                and that the dynamic-scope subschemas include reference targets as well as
                lexical subschemas.
            </t>
            <t>
                The behavior of these keywords depend on the annotation results of
                adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being validated.
            </t>
            <t>
                Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
                require this vocabulary as if its IRI were present with a value of true.
            </t>
            <t>
                The current IRI for this vocabulary, known as the Unevaluated Applicator
                vocabulary, is:
                &lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/next/vocab/unevaluated&gt;.

            <t>

            </t>
            <t>
                Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between
                specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
                SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and
                before the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics
                as those listed here.

                    Schema keywords typically operate independently, without

                    The behavior of this keyword depends on the annotation results of
                    adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being validated.
                    Specifically, the annotations from "prefixItems", "items", and "contains",
                    which can come from those keywords when they are adjacent to the
                    "unevaluatedItems" keyword. Those three annotations, as well as

                    subschema MUST be applied to all locations in the array.
                    If a boolean true value is present from any of the relevant annotations,
                    "unevaluatedItems" MUST be ignored.  Otherwise, the subschema
                    MUST be applied to any index greater than the largest annotation
                    value for "prefixItems", which does not appear in any annotation
                    value for "contains".

                JSON Schema is defined to be platform-independent.  As such, to increase compatibility
                across platforms, implementations SHOULD conform to a standard validation output
                format.  This section describes the minimum requirements that consumers will need to
                properly interpret validation results.

                    JSON Schema output is defined using the JSON Schema data instance model as described
                    in section 4.2.1.  Implementations MAY deviate from this as supported by their
                    specific languages and platforms, however it is RECOMMENDED that the output be
                    convertible to the JSON format defined herein via serialization or other means.

                    The output MUST be an object containing a boolean property named "valid".  When
                    additional information about the result is required, the output MUST also contain
                    "errors" or "annotations" as described below.

                    This instance will fail validation and produce errors, but it's trivial to deduce
                    examples for passing schemas that produce annotations.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Specifically, the errors it will produce are:
                    <list>
                        <t>
                            The second object is missing a "y" property.

                        <t>
                            The second object has a disallowed "z" property.

                        <t>
                            There are only two objects, but three are required.

                    </list>
                    Note that the error message wording as depicted in these examples is not a
                    requirement of this specification.  Implementations SHOULD craft error messages
                    tailored for their audience or provide a templating mechanism that allows their
                    users to craft their own messages.

                        In the simplest case, merely the boolean result for the "valid" valid property
                        needs to be fulfilled.

                        Because no errors or annotations are returned with this format, it is
                        RECOMMENDED that implementations use short-circuiting logic to return
                        failure or success as soon as the outcome can be determined.  For example,
                        if an "anyOf" keyword contains five sub-schemas, and the second one
                        passes, there is no need to check the other three.  The logic can simply
                        return with success.

                        associations between the errors more apparent.  For example, the fact that
                        the missing "y" property and the extra "z" property both stem from the same
                        location in the instance is not immediately obvious in the "Basic" structure.

                        The "Verbose" structure is a fully realized hierarchy that exactly matches
                        that of the schema.  This structure has applications in form generation and
                        validation where the error's location is important.

                        The primary difference between this and the "Detailed" structure is that
                        all results are returned.  This includes sub-schema validation results that
                        would otherwise be removed (e.g. annotations for failed validations,
                        successful validations inside a `not` keyword, etc.).  Because of this, it
                        is RECOMMENDED that each node also carry a `valid` property to indicate the
                        validation result for that node.

                Instances and schemas are both frequently written by untrusted third parties, to be
                deployed on public Internet servers.
                Validators should take care that the parsing and validating against schemas does not consume excessive
                system resources.
                Validators MUST NOT fall into an infinite loop.
            </t>
            <t>
                A malicious party could cause an implementation to repeatedly collect a copy
                of a very large value as an annotation.  Implementations SHOULD guard against
                excessive consumption of system resources in such a scenario.

                Schema authors should take care with "$comment" contents, as a malicious

        <section title="Manipulating schema documents and references">
            <t>
                Various tools have been created to rearrange schema documents
                based on how and where references ("$ref") appear.  This appendix discusses
                which use cases and actions are compliant with this specification.
            </t>
            <section title="Bundling schema resources into a single document">
                <t>
                    A set of schema resources intended for use together can be organized
                    with each in its own schema document, all in the same schema document,
                    or any granularity of document grouping in between.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Numerous tools exist to perform various sorts of reference removal.
                    A common case of this is producing a single file where all references
                    can be resolved within that file.  This is typically done to simplify
                    distribution, or to simplify coding so that various invocations
                    of JSON Schema libraries do not have to keep track of and load
                    a large number of resources.

                    This transformation can be safely and reversibly done as long as
                    all static references (e.g. "$ref") use IRI-references that resolve
                    to canonical IRIs, and all schema resources have an absolute-IRI
                    as the "$id" in their root schema.
                </t>
                <t>
                    With these conditions met, each external resource can be copied
                    under "$defs", without breaking any references among the resources'
                    schema objects, and without changing any aspect of validation or
                    annotation results.  The names of the schemas under "$defs" do
                    not affect behavior, assuming they are each unique, as they
                    do not appear in canonical IRIs for the embedded resources.

                <t>
                    Attempting to remove all references and produce a single schema document does not,
                    in all cases, produce a schema with identical behavior to the original form.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Since "$ref" is now treated like any other keyword, with other keywords allowed
                    in the same schema objects, fully supporting non-recursive "$ref" removal in
                    all cases can require relatively complex schema manipulations.  It is beyond
                    the scope of this specification to determine or provide a set of safe "$ref"
                    removal transformations, as they depend not only on the schema structure
                    but also on the intended usage.

                    Consider the following two schemas describing a simple
                    recursive tree structure, where each node in the tree
                    can have a "data" field of any type.  The first schema
                    allows and ignores other instance properties.  The second is
                    more strict and only allows the "data" and "children" properties.
                    An example instance with "data" misspelled as "daat" is also shown.

            </figure>
            <t>
                When we load these two schemas, we will notice the "$dynamicAnchor"
                named "node" (note the lack of "#" as this is just the name)
                present in each, resulting in the following full schema IRIs:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>"https://example.com/tree#node"</t>
                    <t>"https://example.com/strict-tree#node"</t>
                </list>
                In addition, JSON Schema implementations keep track of the fact
                that these fragments were created with "$dynamicAnchor".
            </t>
            <t>
                If we apply the "strict-tree" schema to the instance, we will follow
                the "$ref" to the "tree" schema, examine its "children" subschema,
                and find the "$dynamicRef": to "#node" (note the "#" for IRI fragment syntax)
                in its "items" subschema.  That reference resolves to
                "https://example.com/tree#node", which is a IRI with a fragment
                created by "$dynamicAnchor".  Therefore we must examine the dynamic
                scope before following the reference.
            </t>
            <t>
                At this point, the dynamic path is
                "#/$ref/properties/children/items/$dynamicRef", with a dynamic scope
                containing (from the outermost scope to the innermost):
                <list style="numbers">
                  <t>"https://example.com/strict-tree#"</t>
                  <t>"https://example.com/tree#"</t>
                  <t>"https://example.com/tree#/properties/children"</t>
                  <t>"https://example.com/tree#/properties/children/items"</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Since we are looking for a plain name fragment, which can be
                defined anywhere within a schema resource, the JSON Pointer fragments
                are irrelevant to this check.  That means that we can remove those
                fragments and eliminate consecutive duplicates, producing:
                <list style="numbers">
                  <t>"https://example.com/strict-tree"</t>
                  <t>"https://example.com/tree"</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                In this case, the outermost resource also has a "node" fragment
                defined by "$dynamicAnchor".  Therefore instead of resolving the
                "$dynamicRef" to "https://example.com/tree#node", we resolve it to
                "https://example.com/strict-tree#node".
            </t>
            <t>
                This way, the recursion in the "tree" schema recurses to the root
                of "strict-tree", instead of only applying "strict-tree" to the
                instance root, but applying "tree" to instance children.
            </t>
            <t>
                This example shows both "$dynamicAnchor"s in the same place
                in each schema, specifically the resource root schema.
                Since plain-name fragments are independent of the JSON structure,
                this would work just as well if one or both of the node schema objects
                were moved under "$defs".  It is the matching "$dynamicAnchor" values
                which tell us how to resolve the dynamic reference, not any sort of
                correlation in JSON structure.

        <section title="Working with vocabularies">
            <section title="Best practices for vocabulary and meta-schema authors">
                <t>
                    Vocabulary authors should
                    take care to avoid keyword name collisions if the vocabulary is intended
                    for broad use, and potentially combined with other vocabularies.  JSON
                    Schema does not provide any formal namespacing system, but also does
                    not constrain keyword names, allowing for any number of namespacing
                    approaches.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Vocabularies may build on each other, such as by defining the behavior
                    of their keywords with respect to the behavior of keywords from another
                    vocabulary, or by using a keyword from another vocabulary with
                    a restricted or expanded set of acceptable values.  Not all such
                    vocabulary re-use will result in a new vocabulary that is compatible
                    with the vocabulary on which it is built.  Vocabulary authors should
                    clearly document what level of compatibility, if any, is expected.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Meta-schema authors should not use "$vocabulary" to combine multiple
                    vocabularies that define conflicting syntax or semantics for the same
                    keyword.  As semantic conflicts are not generally detectable through
                    schema validation, implementations are not expected to detect such
                    conflicts.  If conflicting vocabularies are declared, the resulting
                    behavior is undefined.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Vocabulary authors SHOULD provide a meta-schema that validates the
                    expected usage of the vocabulary's keywords on their own.  Such meta-schemas
                    SHOULD not forbid additional keywords, and MUST not forbid any
                    keywords from the Core vocabulary.
                </t>
                <t>
                    It is recommended that meta-schema authors reference each vocabulary's
                    meta-schema using the <xref target="allOf">"allOf"</xref> keyword,
                    although other mechanisms for constructing the meta-schema may be
                    appropriate for certain use cases.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The recursive nature of meta-schemas makes the "$dynamicAnchor"
                    and "$dynamicRef" keywords particularly useful for extending
                    existing meta-schemas, as can be seen in the JSON Hyper-Schema meta-schema
                    which extends the Validation meta-schema.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Meta-schemas may impose additional constraints, including describing
                    keywords not present in any vocabulary, beyond what the meta-schemas
                    associated with the declared vocabularies describe.  This allows for
                    restricting usage to a subset of a vocabulary, and for validating
                    locally defined keywords not intended for re-use.
                </t>
                <t>
                    However, meta-schemas should not contradict any vocabularies that
                    they declare, such as by requiring a different JSON type than
                    the vocabulary expects.  The resulting behavior is undefined.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Meta-schemas intended for local use, with no need to test for
                    vocabulary support in arbitrary implementations, can safely omit
                    "$vocabulary" entirely.
                </t>

            <section title="Example meta-schema with vocabulary declarations"
                     anchor="example-meta-schema">
                <t>
                    This meta-schema explicitly declares both the Core and Applicator vocabularies,
                    together with an extension vocabulary, and combines their meta-schemas with
                    an "allOf".  The extension vocabulary's meta-schema, which describes only the
                    keywords in that vocabulary, is shown after the main example meta-schema.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The main example meta-schema also restricts the usage of the Unevaluated
                    vocabulary by forbidding the keywords prefixed with "unevaluated", which
                    are particularly complex to implement.  This does not change the semantics
                    or set of keywords defined by the other vocabularies. It just ensures
                    that schemas using this meta-schema that attempt to use the keywords
                    prefixed with "unevaluated" will fail validation against this meta-schema.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Finally, this meta-schema describes the syntax of a keyword, "localKeyword",
                    that is not part of any vocabulary.  Presumably, the implementors and users
                    of this meta-schema will understand the semantics of "localKeyword".
                    JSON Schema does not define any mechanism for expressing keyword semantics
                    outside of vocabularies, making them unsuitable for use except in a
                    specific environment in which they are understood.

                    As shown above, even though each of the single-vocabulary meta-schemas
                    referenced in the general-use meta-schema's "allOf" declares its
                    corresponding vocabulary, this new meta-schema must re-declare them.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The standard meta-schemas that combine all vocabularies defined by
                    the Core and Validation specification, and that combine all vocabularies
                    defined by those specifications as well as the Hyper-Schema specification,
                    demonstrate additional complex combinations.  These IRIs for these
                    meta-schemas may be found in the Validation and Hyper-Schema specifications,
                    respectively.

                <t>
                    While the general-use meta-schema can validate the syntax of "minDate",
                    it is the vocabulary that defines the logic behind the semantic meaning
                    of "minDate".  Without an understanding of the semantics (in this example,
                    that the instance value must be a date equal to or after the date
                    provided as the keyword's value in the schema), an implementation can
                    only validate the syntactic usage.  In this case, that means validating
                    that it is a date-formatted string (using "pattern" to ensure that it is
                    validated even when "format" functions purely as an annotation, as explained
                    in the <xref target="json-schema-validation">Validation specification</xref>.

        <section title="References and generative use cases">
            <t>
                While the presence of references is expected to be transparent
                to validation results, generative use cases such as code generators
                and UI renderers often consider references to be semantically significant.
            </t>
            <t>
                To make such use case-specific semantics explicit, the best practice
                is to create an annotation keyword for use in the same
                schema object alongside of a reference keyword such as "$ref".
            </t>
            <figure>
                <preamble>
                    For example, here is a hypothetical keyword for determining
                    whether a code generator should consider the reference
                    target to be a distinct class, and how those classes are related.
                    Note that this example is solely for illustrative purposes, and is
                    not intended to propose a functional code generation keyword.

                Here, this schema represents some sort of object-oriented class.
                The first reference in the "allOf" is noted as the base class.
                The second is not assigned a class relationship, meaning that the
                code generator should combine the target's definition with this
                one as if no reference were involved.
            </t>
            <t>
                Looking at the properties, "foo" is flagged as object composition,
                while the "date" property is not.  It is simply a field with
                sub-fields, rather than an instance of a distinct class.
            </t>
            <t>
                This style of usage requires the annotation to be in the same object
                as the reference, which must be recognizable as a reference.
