                JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON-based format
                for describing the structure of JSON data.
                JSON Schema asserts what a JSON document must look like,
                ways to extract information from it,
                and how to interact with it.
                The "application/schema-instance+json" media type provides additional
                feature-rich integration with "application/schema+json" beyond what can be offered
                for "application/json" documents.

            <t>
                JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema
                is intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and interaction
                control of JSON data.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification defines JSON Schema core terminology and mechanisms, including
                pointing to another JSON Schema by reference,
                dereferencing a JSON Schema reference,
                specifying the vocabulary being used,
                and defining the expected output.
            </t>
            <t>
                Other specifications define the vocabularies that perform assertions about validation,
                linking, annotation, navigation, and interaction.

            <t>
                This document proposes a new media type "application/schema+json" to identify a JSON
                Schema for describing JSON data.
                It also proposes a further optional media type, "application/schema-instance+json",
                to provide additional integration features.
                JSON Schemas are themselves JSON documents.
                This, and related specifications, define keywords allowing authors to describe JSON
                data in several ways.
            </t>

            <section title="Keyword Behaviors">
                <t>
                    JSON Schema keywords fall into several general behavior categories.
                    Assertions validate that an instance satisfies constraints, producing
                    a boolean result.  Annotations attach information that applications
                    may use in any way they see fit.
                    Applicators apply subschemas to parts of the instance and combine
                    their results.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Extension keywords SHOULD stay within these categories, keeping in mind
                    that annotations in particular are extremely flexible.  Complex behavior
                    is usually better delegated to applications on the basis of annotation
                    data than implemented directly as schema keywords.  However, extension
                    keywords MAY define other behaviors for specialized purposes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Evaluating an instance against a schema involves processing all of the
                    keywords in the schema against the appropriate locations within the instance.
                    Typically, applicator keywords are processed until a schema object with no
                    applicators (and therefore no subschemas) is reached.  The appropriate
                    location in the instance is evaluated against the assertion and
                    annotation keywords in the schema object, and their results are gathered
                    into the parent schema according to the rules of the applicator.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Evaluation of a parent schema object can complete once all of its
                    subschemas have been evaluated, although in some circumstance evaluation
                    may be short-circuited due to assertion results.
                </t>
                <section title="Keyword Interactions">
                    <t>
                        Keyword behavior MAY be defined in terms of the annotation results
                        of <xref target="root">subschemas</xref> and/or adjacent keywords.
                        Such keywords MUST NOT result in a circular dependency.
                        Keywords MAY modify their behavior based on the presence or absence
                        of another keyword in the same
                        <xref target="schema-document">schema object</xref>.
                    </t>
                </section>
                <section title="Default Behaviors">
                    <t>
                        A missing keyword MUST NOT produce a false assertion result, MUST
                        NOT produce annotation results, and MUST NOT cause any other schema
                        to be evaluated as part of its own behavioral definition.
                        However, given that missing keywords do not contribute annotations,
                        the lack of annotation results may indirectly change the behavior
                        of other keywords.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        In some cases, the missing keyword assertion behavior of a keyword is
                        identical to that produced by a certain value, and keyword definitions
                        SHOULD note such values where known.  However, even if the value which
                        produces the default behavior would produce annotation results if
                        present, the default behavior still MUST NOT result in annotations.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Because annotation collection can add significant cost in terms of both
                        computation and memory, implementations MAY opt out of this feature.
                        Keywords known to an implementation to have assertion or applicator behavior
                        that depend on annotation results MUST then be treated as errors, unless
                        an alternate implementation producing the same behavior is available.
                        Keywords of this sort SHOULD describe reasonable alternate approaches
                        when appropriate.  This approach is demonstrated by the
                        "<xref target="additionalItems" format="title"/>" and
                        "<xref target="additionalProperties" format="title"/>" keywords in this
                        document.
                    </t>
                </section>
                <section title="Applicators" anchor="applicators">
                    <t>
                        Applicators allow for building more complex schemas than can be accomplished
                        with a single schema object.  Evaluation of an instance against a
                        <xref target="schema-document">schema document</xref> begins by applying
                        the <xref target="root">root schema</xref> to the complete instance
                        document.  From there, keywords known as applicators are used to determine
                        which additional schemas are applied.  Such schemas may be applied in-place
                        to the current location, or to a child location.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The schemas to be applied may be present as subschemas comprising all or
                        part of the keyword's value.  Alternatively, an applicator may refer to
                        a schema elsewhere in the same schema document, or in a different one.
                        The mechanism for identifying such referenced schemas is defined by the
                        keyword.

                    <t>
                        Applicator keywords also define how subschema or referenced schema
                        boolean <xref target="assertions">assertion</xref>
                        results are modified and/or combined to produce the boolean result
                        of the applicator.  Applicators may apply any boolean logic operation
                        to the assertion results of subschemas, but MUST NOT introduce new
                        assertion conditions of their own.

                        <xref target="annotations">Annotation</xref> results are

                    <t>
                        JSON Schema can be used to assert constraints on a JSON document, which
                        either passes or fails the assertions.  This approach can be used to validate
                        conformance with the constraints, or document what is needed to satisfy them.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        JSON Schema implementations produce a single boolean result when evaluating
                        an instance against schema assertions.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An instance can only fail an assertion that is present in the schema.

                    <section title="Assertions and Instance Primitive Types">
                        <t>
                            Most assertions only constrain values within a certain
                            primitive type.  When the type of the instance is not of the type
                            targeted by the keyword, the instance is considered to conform
                            to the assertion.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            For example, the "maxLength" keyword from the companion validation
                            vocabulary will only restrict certain strings
                            (that are too long) from being valid.  If the instance is a number,
                            boolean, null, array, or object, then it is valid against this assertion.

                        JSON Schema can annotate an instance with information, whenever the instance
                        validates against the schema object containing the annotation, and all of its
                        parent schema objects.  The information can be a simple value, or can be
                        calculated based on the instance contents.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Annotations are attached to specific locations in an instance.
                        Since many subschemas can be applied to any single
                        location, annotation keywords need to specify any unusual handling of
                        multiple applicable occurrences of the keyword with different values.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The default behavior is simply to collect all values in a list in
                        indeterminate order.  Given the extensibility of keywords, including
                        applicators, it is not possible to define a universally predictable
                        order of processing.

                    <t>
                        Unlike assertion results, annotation data can take a wide variety of forms,
                        which are provided to applications to use as they see fit.  JSON Schema
                        implementations are not expected to make use of the collected information
                        on behalf of applications.

                    <t>
                        While "short-circuit" evaluation is possible for assertions, collecting
                        annotations requires examining all schemas that apply to an instance
                        location, even if they cannot change the overall assertion result.

                    be re-usable, although users of extension vocabularies MUST NOT
                    assume that any JSON Schema implementation can support the vocabulary
                    unless it specifically documents such support.

                    In JSON Schema, the terms "JSON document", "JSON text", and "JSON value" are
                    interchangeable because of the data model it defines.

                    JSON Schema is only defined over JSON documents. However, any document or memory
                    structure that can be parsed into or processed according to the JSON Schema data
                    model can be interpreted against a JSON Schema, including media types like

                        An instance has one of six primitive types, and a range of possible values

                        defined here.  As an example, "integer" is a reasonable type for a
                        vocabulary to define as a value for a keyword, but the data model
                        makes no distinction between integers and other numbers.

                        URI fragment identifier syntax and semantics.  These features are
                        useful in content negotiation and in calculating URIs for specific

                        While most JSON Schema keywords can be evaluated on their own,
                        or at most need to take into account the values or results of
                        adjacent keywords in the same schema object, a few have more
                        complex behavior.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The lexical scope of a keyword is deterimined by the nested JSON
                        data structure of objects and arrays.  The largest such scope
                        is an entire schema document.  The smallest scope is a single
                        schema object with no subschemas.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Keywords MAY be defined with a partial value, such as a URI-reference,
                        which must be resolved against another value, such as another
                        URI-reference or a full URI, which is found through the lexical
                        structure of the JSON document.  The "$id" core keyword and
                        the "base" JSON Hyper-Schema keyword are examples of this sort
                        of behavior.  Additionally, "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" from
                        this specification resolve their values in this way, although
                        they do not change how further values are resolved.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Note that some keywords, such as "$schema", apply to the lexical
                        scope of the entire schema document, and therefore MUST only
                        appear in the document's root schema.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Other keywords may take into account the dynamic scope that
                        exists during the evaluation of a schema, typically together
                        with an instance document.  The outermost dynamic scope is the
                        root schema of the schema document in which processing begins.
                        The path from this root schema to any particular keyword (that
                        includes any "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" keywords that may have
                        been resolved) is considered the keyword's "validation path."
                        <cref>
                            Or should this be the schema object at which processing
                            begins, even if it is not a root?  This has some implications
                            for the case where "$recursiveAnchor" is only allowed in the
                            root schema but processing begins in a subschema.
                        </cref>
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Lexical and dynamic scopes align until a reference keyword
                        is encountered.  While following the reference keyword jumps
                        from one lexical scope into a different one, from the perspective
                        of dynamic scope, following reference is no different from descending
                        into a subschema present as a value.  A keyword on the far side of
                        that reference that resolves information through the dynamic scope
                        will consider the originating side of the reference to be their
                        dynamic parent, rather than examining the local lexically enclosing parent.

                    <t>
                        The concept of dynamic scope is primarily used with "$recursiveRef",
                        "$recursiveAnchor", and should be considered an advanced feature
                        and used with caution when defining additional keywords.

                        As noted in <xref target="applicators" />, an applicator keyword may
                        refer to a schema to be applied, rather than including it as a
                        subschema in the applicator's value.  In such situations, the
                        schema being applied is known as the referenced schema, while
                        the schema containing the applicator keyword is the referencing schema.

                        While root schemas and subschemas are static concepts based on a

                        schemas are dynamic.  Different pairs of schemas may find themselves
                        in various referenced and referencing arrangements during the evaluation
                        of an instance against a schema.

                        by static analysis of the schema document's lexical scope.  Others,
                        such as "$recursiveRef" and "$recursiveAnchor",  may make use of dynamic
                        scoping, and therefore only be resolvable in the process of evaluating
                        the schema with an instance.

                     These regular expressions SHOULD be valid according to the

                    A subschema's "$id" is resolved against the base URI of its parent schema.
                    If no parent sets an explicit base with "$id", the base URI is that of the

                        When an "$id" sets the base URI, the object containing that "$id" and all of
                        its subschemas can be identified by using a JSON Pointer fragment starting
                        from that location.  This is true even of subschemas that further change the
                        base URI.  Therefore, a single subschema may be accessible by multiple URIs,
                        each consisting of base URI declared in the subschema or a parent, along with
                        a JSON Pointer fragment identifying the path from the schema object that
                        declares the base to the subschema being identified.  Examples of this are
                        shown in section <xref target="idExamples" format="counter"></xref>.

                    <t>
                        Using JSON Pointer fragments requires knowledge of the structure of the schema.
                        When writing schema documents with the intention to provide re-usable
                        schemas, it may be preferable to use a plain name fragment that is not tied to
                        any particular structural location.  This allows a subschema to be relocated
                        without requiring JSON Pointer references to be updated.

                    <t>
                        To specify such a subschema identifier,
                        the "$id" keyword is set to a URI reference with a plain name fragment (not a JSON Pointer fragment).
                        This value MUST begin with the number sign that specifies a fragment ("#"),
                        then a letter ([A-Za-z]),
                        followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"),
                        colons (":"), or periods (".").
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The effect of using a fragment in "$id" that isn't blank or doesn't follow the
                        plain name syntax is undefined.
                        <cref>
                            How should an "$id" URI reference containing a fragment with other components
                            be interpreted?  There are two cases:  when the other components match
                            the current base URI and when they change the base URI.

                    Several keywords can be used to reference a schema which is to be applied to the
                    current instance location. "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" are an applicator
                    keywords, applying the referenced schema to the instance.  "$recursiveAnchor"
                    is a helper keyword that controls how the referenced schema of "$recursiveRef"
                    is determined.
                </t>
                <t>
                    As the value of "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" are URI References, this allows
                    the possibility to externalise or divide a schema across multiple files,
                    and provides the ability to validate recursive structures through
                    self-reference.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The resolved URI produced by these keywords is not necessarily a network
                    locator, only an identifier. A schema need not be downloadable from the
                    address if it is a network-addressable URL, and implementations SHOULD NOT
                    assume they should perform a network operation when they encounter
                    a network-addressable URI.

                        The value of the "$ref" property MUST be a string which is a URI Reference.
                        Resolved against the current URI base, it identifies the URI of a schema
                        to use.

                        extensible recursive schemas.  A recursive schema is one that has
                        a reference to its own root, identified by the empty fragment
                        URI reference ("#").

                        Extending a recursive schema with "$ref" alone involves redefining all
                        recursive references in the source schema to point to the root of the
                        extension.  This produces the correct recursive behavior in the extension,
                        which is that all recursion should reference the root of the extension.

                            This apparent duplication is important because
                            it resolves to "https://example.com/extension#", meaning that
                            for instance validated against the extension schema, the value
                            of "r" must be valid according to the extension, and not just the
                            original schema as "r" was described there.

                        This approach is fine for a single recursive field, but the more
                        complicated the original schema, the more redefinitions are necessary
                        in the extension.  This leads to a verbose and error-prone extension,
                        which must be kept synchronized with the original schema if the
                        original changes its recursive fields.
                        This approach can be seen in the meta-schema for JSON Hyper-Schema
                        in all prior drafts.

                            The desired behavior is for the recursive reference, "r", in the

                            is the only schema being used, but to resolve to the extension
                            schema when using the extension.  Then there would be no need
                            to redefine the "r" property, or others like it, in the extension.

                            that it only behaves as it appears to, using lexical scoping.

                            schema.  This keyword MAY appear in the root schema of a

                            The "$recursiveRef" keyword behaves identically to "$ref", except
                            that if the referenced schema has "$recursiveAnchor" set to true,
                            then the implementation MUST examine the dynamic scope for the

                            set to true.  If such a schema document exists, then the target
                            of the "$recursiveRef" MUST be set to that document's URI, in
                            place of the URI produced by the rules for "$ref".

                            When using the original schema on its own, there is no change
                            in behavior.  The "$recursiveRef" does lead to a schema where
                            "$recursiveAnchor" is set to true, but since the original schema
                            is the only schema document in the dynamics scope (it references
                            itself, and does not reference any other schema documents), the
                            behavior is effectively the same as "$ref".
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            When using the extension schema, the "$recursiveRef" within
                            that schema (for the array items within "things") also effectively
                            behaves like "$ref".  The extension schema is the outermost
                            dynamic scope, so the reference target is not changed.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            In contrast, when using the extension schema, the "$recursiveRef"
                            for "r" in the original schema now behaves differently.  Its
                            initial target is the root schema of the original schema document,
                            which has "$recursiveAnchor" set to true. In this case, the
                            outermost dynamic scope that also has "$recursiveAnchor" set to
                            true is the extension schema.  So when using the extensions schema,
                            "r"'s reference in the original schema will resolve to
                            "https://example.com/extension#", not "https://example.com/original#".

                        The use of URIs to identify remote schemas does not necessarily mean anything is downloaded,
                        but instead JSON Schema implementations SHOULD understand ahead of time which schemas they will be using,
                        and the URIs that identify them.

                        When schemas are downloaded,

                        Implementations SHOULD be able to associate arbitrary URIs with an arbitrary
                        schema and/or automatically associate a schema's "$id"-given URI, depending
                        on the trust that the validator has in the schema.  Such URIs and schemas
                        can be supplied to an implementation prior to processing instances, or may
                        be noted within a schema document as it is processed, producing associations

                        as the same URI, validators SHOULD raise an error condition.

                        document.  If a schema with that identifier has otherwise been supplied to

                            new schemas will be added to the system dynamically, so placing an

                This keyword is reserved for comments from schema authors to readers or
                maintainers of the schema.

                The value of this keyword MUST be a string. Implementations MUST NOT present this
                string to end users.  Tools for editing schemas SHOULD support displaying and
                editing this keyword.  The value of this keyword MAY be used in debug or error
                output which is intended for developers making use of schemas.

                Schema vocabularies SHOULD allow "$comment" within any object containing
                vocabulary keywords.  Implementations MAY assume "$comment" is allowed
                unless the vocabulary specifically forbids it.  Vocabularies MUST NOT
                specify any effect of "$comment" beyond what is described in this
                specification.

                Tools that translate other media types or programming languages
                to and from application/schema+json MAY choose to convert that media type or
                programming language's native comments to or from "$comment" values.
                The behavior of such translation when both native comments and "$comment"
                properties are present is implementation-dependent.

                Implementations SHOULD treat "$comment" identically to an unknown extension
                keyword.  They MAY strip "$comment" values at any point during processing.
                In particular, this allows for shortening schemas when the size of deployed
                schemas is a concern.

                Implementations MUST NOT take any other action based on the presence, absence,
                or contents of "$comment" properties.  In particular, the value of "$comment"
                MUST NOT be collected as an annotation result.

                    In this example, both Feature A and Feature B make use of the re-usable
                    "enabledToggle" schema.  That schema uses the "title", "description",
                    and "default" annotations, none of which define special behavior for
                    handling multiple values.  Therefore the application has to decide how
                    to handle the additional "default" value for Feature A, and the additional
                    "description" value for Feature B.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The application programmer and the schema author need to agree on the
                    usage.  For this example, let's assume that they agree that the most
                    specific "default" value will be used, and any additional, more generic
                    "default" values will be silently ignored.  Let's also assume that they
                    agree that all "description" text is to be used, starting with the most
                    generic, and ending with the most specific.  This requires the schema
                    author to write descriptions that work when combined in this way.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The application can use the schema location path to determine which
                    values are which.  The values in the feature's immediate "enabled"
                    property schema are more specific, while the values under the re-usable
                    schema that is referenced to with "$ref" are more generic.  The schema
                    location path will show whether each value was found by crossing a
                    "$ref" or not.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Feature A will therefore use a default value of true, while Feature B
                    will use the generic default value of null.  Feature A will only
                    have the generic description from the "enabledToggle" schema, while
                    Feature B will use that description, and also append its locally
                    defined description that explains how to interpret a null value.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Note that there are other reasonable approaches that a different application
                    might take.  For example, an application may consider the presence of
                    two different values for "default" to be an error, regardless of their
                    schema locations.

                    Schema objects that produce a false assertion result MUST NOT

                            Specifically, the annotations from "properties", "patternProperties",

            <t>
                JSON Schema is defined to be platform-independent.  As such, to increase compatibility
                across platforms, implementations SHOULD conform to a standard validation output
                format.  This section describes the minimum requirements that consumers will need to
                properly interpret validation results.
            </t>

            <section title="Format">
                <t>
                    JSON Schema output is defined using the JSON Schema data instance model as described
                    in section 4.2.1.  Implementations MAY deviate from this as supported by their
                    specific languages and platforms, however it is RECOMMENDED that the output be
                    convertible to the JSON format defined herein via serialization or other means.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Output Formats">
                <t>
                    This specification defines four output formats.  See the *Output Structure*
                    section for the requirements of each format.
                    <list>
                        <t>
                            Flag - A boolean which simply indicates whether the schema was
                            validated.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Basic - Provides validation information in a flat list structure.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Detailed - Provides validation information in a condensed hierarchical
                            structure based on the structure of the schema.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Verbose - Provides validation information in an uncondensed hierarchical
                            structure that matches the exact structure of the schema.
                        </t>
                    </list>
                    Implementations SHOULD specify which formats of validation they support.  Each
                    format is independent of the others.  For example, if an implementation decides
                    to support the "detailed" format, it is not also required to support the "basic"
                    or "flag" formats, and vice versa.

                <t>
                    Beyond the simplistic "Flag" output, additional information is useful to aid in
                    debugging a schema or instance.  Each sub-result SHOULD contain the information

                    This instance will fail validation and produce errors, but it's trivial to deduce
                    examples for passing schemas that produce annotations.

                <t>
                    Specifically, the errors it will produce are:

                        <t>
                            The second element in the "vertices" property is missing a "y" property.

                        <t>
                            The second element in the "vertices" property has a disallowed "z" property.

                            There are only two vertices, but three are required.

                    Note that neither the error message property nor its wording as depicted in these
                    examples is not a requirement of this specification.  Implementations SHOULD craft
                    error messages tailored for their audience.

                        Because no errors or annotations are returned with this format, it is

                        failure or success as soon as the outcome can be determined.  For example,
                        if an "anyOf" keyword contains five sub-schemas, and the second one
                        passes, there is no need to check the other three.  The logic can simply
                        return with success.

                        The **Verbose** structure is a fully realized hierarchy that exactly matches
                        that of the schema.  This structure has applications in form generation and
                        validation where the error's location is important.

                    <t>
                        The primary difference between this and the **Detailed** structure is that
                        *all* results are returned.  This includes sub-schema validation results that
                        would otherwise be removed (e.g. annotations for failed validations,
                        successful validations inside a `not` keyword, etc.).  Because of this, it
                        is RECOMMENDED that each node also carry a `valid` property to indicate the
                        validation result for that node.

                <t>
                    Media types MAY allow for a "schema" media type parameter, which gives
                    HTTP servers the ability to perform Content-Type Negotiation based on schema.
                    The media-type parameter MUST be a whitespace-separated list of URIs
                    (i.e. relative references are invalid).
                </t>
                <t>
                    When using the media type application/schema-instance+json, the "schema"
                    parameter MUST be supplied.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The schema URI is opaque and SHOULD NOT automatically be dereferenced.
                    If the implementation does not understand the semantics of the provided schema,
                    the implementation can instead follow the "describedby" links, if any, which may
                    provide information on how to handle the schema.
                    Since "schema" doesn't necessarily point to a network location, the
                    "describedby" relation is used for linking to a downloadable schema.
                    However, for simplicity, schema authors should make these URIs point to the same
                    resource when possible.

                <t>
                    In HTTP, the media-type parameter would be sent inside the Content-Type header:

                    <xref target="RFC7231">HTTP</xref> is frequently the protocol of choice for
                    distributing schemas. Misbehaving clients can pose problems for server
                    maintainers if they pull a schema over the network more frequently than
                    necessary, when it's instead possible to cache a schema for a long period of
                    time.
                </t>
                <t>
                    HTTP servers SHOULD set long-lived caching headers on JSON Schemas.
                    HTTP clients SHOULD observe caching headers and not re-request documents within
                    their freshness period.
                    Distributed systems SHOULD make use of a shared cache and/or caching proxy.

                    Clients SHOULD set or prepend a User-Agent header specific to the JSON Schema
                    implementation or software product. Since symbols are listed in decreasing order
                    of significance, the JSON Schema library name/version should precede the more
                    generic HTTP library name (if any). For example:

                <t>
                    Clients SHOULD be able to make requests with a "From" header so that server
                    operators can contact the owner of a potentially misbehaving script.

                Instances and schemas are both frequently written by untrusted third parties, to be
                deployed on public Internet servers.
                Validators should take care that the parsing and validating against schemas doesn't consume excessive
