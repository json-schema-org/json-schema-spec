    <section title="Overview">
      <t>JSON Schema defines the media type application/schema+json for 
      describing the structure of other
      JSON documents. JSON Schema is JSON-based and includes facilities 
      for describing the structure of JSON documents in terms of
      allowable values, descriptions, and interpreting relations with other resources.</t>
      
      <t>JSON Schema format is organized into several separate definitions. The first 
      definition is the core schema specification. This definition is primary 
      concerned with describing a JSON structure and specifying valid elements
      in the structure. The second definition is the Hyper Schema specification
      which is intended define elements in a structure that can be interpreted as
      hyperlinks.
      Hyper Schema builds on JSON Schema to describe the hyperlink structure of 
      other JSON documents. This allows user agents to be able to successfully navigate
      JSON documents based on their schemas.</t>
      
      <t>
      Cumulatively JSON Schema acts as a meta-document that can be used to define the required type and constraints on
      property values, as well as define the meaning of the property values
      for the purpose of describing a resource and determining hyperlinks
      within the representation. </t>

	<t>
	An example JSON Schema that describes products might look like:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
{
  "name":"Product",
  "properties":{
    "id":{
      "type":"number",
      "description":"Product identifier"
    },
    "name":{
      "description":"Name of the product",
      "type":"string"
    },
    "price":{
      "type": "number",
      "minimum":0
    },
    "tags":{
      "optional":true,
      "type":"array",
      "items":{
         "type":"string"
      }
    }
  },
  "links":[
    {
      "rel":"full",
      "href":"{id}"
    },
    {
      "rel":"comments",
      "href":"comments/?id={id}"
    }
  ]
}
]]></artwork></figure>
This schema defines the properties of the instance JSON documents and 
their required properties (id, name, and price) as well as an optional
property (tags). This also defines the link relations of the instance
JSON documents.
	</t>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>For this specification, a schema will be used to denote a JSON Schema 
      definition, and an instance refers to the JSON object or array that the schema 
      will be describing and validating</t>

      </section>
	<section title="Design Considerations">
	<t>
	The JSON Schema media type does not attempt to dictate the structure of JSON
	representations that contain data, but rather provides a separate format
	for flexibly communicating how a JSON representation should be
	interpreted and validated, such that user agents can properly understand
	acceptable structures and extrapolate hyperlink information
	with the JSON document. This specification does not define a protocol.
	The underlying protocol (such as HTTP) should sufficiently define the
	semantics of the client-server interface, the retrieval of resource
	representations linked to by JSON representations, and modification of 
	those resources. The goal of this
	format is to sufficiently describe JSON structures such that one can
	utilize existing information available in existing JSON
	representations from a large variety of services that leverage a REST
	architecture using existing protocols.
</t>
	</section>
    </section>
    
	<section title="Schema/Instance Association">
	<t>
	JSON Schema instances are correlated to their schema by the "describedby"
	relation, where the schema is defined to be the target of the relation.
	Instance representations may be of the application/json media type or
	any other subtype. Consequently, dictating how an instance
	representation should specify the relation to the schema is beyond the normative scope
	of this document (since this document specifically defines the JSON
	Schema media type, and no other), but it is recommended that instances
	specify their schema so that user agents can interpret the instance
	representation and messages may retain the self-descriptive
	characteristic, avoiding the need for out-of-band information about
	instance data. Two approaches are recommended for declaring the
	relation to the schema that describes the meaning of a JSON instance's (or collection 
	of instances) structure. A MIME type parameter named
	"describedby" or a Link header with a relation of "describedby" SHOULD be used:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
Content-Type: application/json; 
              describedby=http://json.com/my-hyper-schema
]]></artwork></figure>	
	or if the content is being transferred by a protocol (such as HTTP) that
	provides headers, a Link header can be used:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
Link: <http://json.com/my-hyper-schema>; rel="describedby"
]]></artwork></figure>
	Instances MAY specify multiple schemas, to indicate all the schemas that 
	are applicable to the data. The instance data may have multiple schemas 
	that it is defined by (the instance data should be valid for those schemas). 
	Or if the document is a collection of instances, the collection may contain 
	instances from different schemas. When collections contain heterogeneous 
	instances, the pathStart attribute MAY be specified in the 
	schema to disambiguate which schema should be applied for each item in the 
collection.
	</t>
	<section title="Self-Descriptive Schema">
	<t>
	JSON Schemas are themselves instances for the schema 
	schemas. A self-describing JSON Schema for the core JSON Schema can
	be found at http://json-schema.org/schema and the hyper schema 
	self-description can be found at: http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema. All schemas
	used within a protocol with media type definitions
	SHOULD include a MIME parameter that refers to the self-descriptive
	hyper schema or another schema that extends this hyper schema:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
Content-Type: application/json; 
              describedby=http://www.json-schema.org/hyper-schema
]]></artwork></figure>
	</t>
	</section>
	</section>
	
      <section title="Core Schema Definition">
        <t>A JSON Schema is a JSON Object that defines various attributes 
        of the instance and defines it's usage and valid values. A JSON 
        Schema is a JSON Object with schema attribute properties. 
        The following is the grammar of a JSON Schema:
	</t>


	<t>And an example JSON Schema definition could look like:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
{"description":"A person",
 "type":"object",

 "properties":
  {"name": {"type":"string"},
   "age" : {"type":"integer",
     "maximum":125}}
}     
	]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	
	<t>A JSON Schema object may have any of the following properties, called schema
	attributes (all attributes are optional):
      </t>

<section title="type">
<t>
<list><t>Union type definition - An array with two or more items which indicates a union of type definitions. Each item in the array may be a simple type definition or a schema. The instance value is valid if it is of the same type as one the type definitions in the array or if it is valid by one of the schemas in the array. For example to indicate that a string or number is a valid:
{"type":["string","number"]}</t>
<t>Simple type definition - A string indicating a primitive or simple type. The following are acceptable strings:

 
<list> 
<t>string - Value must be a string.
</t> 
<t>number - Value must be a number, floating point numbers are allowed. </t> 
<t>integer - Value must be an integer, no floating point numbers are allowed. This is a subset of the number type.</t> 
<t>boolean - Value must be a boolean. </t> 
<t>object - Value must be an object.</t> 
<t>array - Value must be an array.
</t> 
<t>null - Value must be null. Note this is mainly for purpose of being able use union types to define nullability. </t> 
<t>any - Value may be of any type including null.
If the property is not defined or is not in this list, than any type of value is acceptable. Other type values may be used for custom purposes, but minimal validators of the specification implementation can allow any instance value on unknown type values.</t> 
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section> 
<section title="properties">
<t>This should be an object type definition, which is an object with property definitions that correspond to instance object properties. When the instance value is an object, the property values of the instance object must conform to the property definitions in this object. In this object, each property definition's value should be a schema, and the property's name should be the name of the instance property that it defines.</t>
</section> 
<section title="items">
<t>This should be a schema or an array of schemas. When this is an object/schema and the instance value is an array, all the items in the array must conform to this schema. When this is an array of schemas and the instance value is an array, each position in the instance array must conform to the schema in the corresponding position for this array. This called tuple typing. When tuple typing is used, additional items are allowed, disallowed, or constrained by the additionalProperties attribute using the same rules as extra properties for objects..</t>
</section> 
<section title="optional">
<t>This indicates that the instance property in the instance object is optional. This is false by default.</t>
</section> 
<section title="additionalProperties">
<t>This provides a default property definition for all properties that are not explicitly defined in an object type definition. The value must be a schema. If false is provided, no additional properties are allowed, and the schema can not be extended. The default value is an empty schema which allows any value for additional properties.</t>
</section> 
<section title="requires">
<t>This indicates that if this property is present in the containing instance object, the property given by requires attribute must also be present in the containing instance object. The value
of this property may be a string, indicating the require property name. Or the value may be a schema, in which case the containing instance must be valid by the schema if the property is present. For example if a object type definition is defined:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
{ 
  "state":
  {
    "optional":true
  },
  "town":
  {
    "requires":"state",
    "optional":true
  }
}
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<t>An instance must include a state property if a town property is included. If a town property is not included, the state property is optional.</t>
</section> 
<section title="minimum">
<t>This indicates the minimum value for the instance property when the type of the instance value is a number.</t>
</section> 
<section title="maximum">
<t>This indicates the minimum value for the instance property when the type of the instance value is a number.</t>
</section> 
<section title="minimumCanEqual">
<t>If the minimum is defined, this indicates whether or not the instance property value can equal the minimum.</t>
</section> 
<section title="maximumCanEqual">
<t>If the maximum is defined, this indicates whether or not the instance property value can equal the maximum.</t>
</section> 
<section title="minItems">
<t>This indicates the minimum number of values in an array when an array is the instance value.</t>
</section> 
<section title="maxItems">
<t>This indicates the maximum number of values in an array when an array is the instance value.</t>
</section> 
<section title="pattern">
<t>When the instance value is a string, this provides a regular expression that a instance string value should match in order to be valid. Regular expressions should follow the regular expression specification from ECMA 262/Perl 5</t></section>
<section title="maxLength">
<t>When the instance value is a string, this indicates maximum length of the string.</t>
</section> 
<section title="minLength">
<t>When the instance value is a string, this indicates minimum length of the string.</t>
</section> 
<section title="enum">
<t>This provides an enumeration of possible values that are valid for the instance property. This should be an array, and each item in the array represents a possible value for the instance value. If "enum" is included, the instance value must be one of the values in enum array in order for the schema to be valid.</t>
</section> 
<section title="title">
<t>This provides a short description of the instance property. The value must be a string.</t>
</section> 
<section title="description">
<t>This provides a full description of the of purpose the instance property. The value must be a string.</t>
</section> 
<section title="format"><t>This property indicates the type of data, content type, or microformat to be expected in the instance property values. A format attribute may be one of the values listed below, and if so, should adhere to the semantics describing for the format. A format should only be used give meaning to primitive types (string, integer, number, or boolean). Validators are not required to validate that the instance values conform to a format. The following formats are defined:</t>
<list>
<t>Any valid MIME media type may be used as a format value, in which case the instance property value must be a string, representing the contents of the MIME file. 
</t><t>date-time - This should be a date in ISO 8601 format of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ in UTC time. This is the recommended form of date/timestamp.
</t><t>date - This should be a date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. It is recommended that you use the "date-time" format instead of "date" unless you need to transfer only the date part.
</t><t>time - This should be a time in the format of hh:mm:ss. It is recommended that you use the "date-time" format instead of "time" unless you need to transfer only the time part.
</t><t>utc-millisec - This should be the difference, measured in milliseconds, between the specified time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. The value should be a number (integer or float).
</t><t>regex - A regular expression.
</t><t>color - This is a CSS color (like "#FF0000" or "red").
</t><t>style - This is a CSS style definition (like "color: red; background-color:#FFF").
</t><t>phone - This should be a phone number (format may follow E.123).
</t><t>uri - This value should be a URI..
</t><t>email - This should be an email address.
</t><t>ip-address - This should be an ip version 4 address.
</t><t>ipv6 - This should be an ip version 6 address.</t>
<t>street-address - This should be a street address.</t> 
<t>locality - This should be a city or town.</t> 
<t>region - This should be a region (a state in the US, province in Canada, etc.)</t> 
<t>postal-code - This should be a postal code (AKA zip code).</t> 
<t>country - This should be the name of a country.</t> 
<t>Additional custom formats may be defined with a URL to a definition of the format.</t>
</list>
</section> 
<section title="contentEncoding"><t>
If the instance property value is a string, this indicates that the string should be interpreted as binary data and decoded using the encoding named by this schema property. RFC 2045, Sec 6.1 lists possible values.
</t>
</section>
<section title="default">
<t>This indicates the default for the instance property.</t>
</section> 
<section title="maxDecimal">
<t>This indicates the maximum number of decimal places in a floating point number. By default there is no maximum.</t>
</section> 
<section title="disallow">
<t>This attribute may take the same values as the "type" attribute, however if the instance matches the type or if this value is an array and the instance matches any type or schema in the array, than this instance is not valid.</t>
</section> 
<section title="extends">
<t>The value of this property should be another schema which will provide a base schema which the current schema will inherit from. The inheritance rules are such that any instance that is valid according to the current schema must be valid according to the referenced schema. This may also be an array, in which case, the instance must be valid for all the schemas in the array.</t>
</section> 
    </section>
<section title="Hyper Schema">
      <t>This section defines hypermedia definitions of JSON schema. 
      The following attributes are specified in addition to those
attributes that already provided by JSON schema with the specific
purpose of informing user agents of relations between resources based
on JSON data. Just as with JSON
schema attributes, all the attributes in hyper-schema are optional.
Therefore an empty object is a valid (non-informative) schema, and
essentially describes plain JSON (no constraints on the structures).
Addition of attributes provides additive information for user agents.</t>
<section title="links">
<t>
The value of the links property should be an array, where each item 
in the array is a link description object which describes the link
relations of the instances.
</t>
<section title="Link Description Object">
<t>
A link description object is used to describe the link relations 
of instances of a schema.
</t>
<section title="href">
    <t>
    The value of the "href" link description property
indicates the target URI of the related resource. The value
of the instance property should be resolved as a URI-Reference per [RFC3986]
and may be a relative URI. The base URI to be used for relative resolution
should be the URI used to retrieve the instance object (not the schema). 
Also, the URI may be parametrized by the property values of the instance 
object.
</t>
<t>
Instance property values should be substituted into the URIs where
matching braces ('{', '}') are found surrounding zero or more characters,
creating an expanded URI. Instance property value substitutions are resolved
by using the text between the braces to denote the property name
from the instance to get the value to substitute. For example,
if an href value is defined:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
http://somesite.com/{id}
]]></artwork>
</figure>
Then it would be resolved by replace the value of the "id" property value from
the instance object. If the value of the "id" property was "45", the expanded
URI would be:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
http://somesite.com/45
]]></artwork>
</figure>
If matching braces are found with the string "-this" (no quotes) between the braces, than the 
actual instance value should be used to replace the braces, rather than a property value.
This should only be used in situations where the instance is a scalar (string, 
boolean, or number), and not for objects or arrays.
</t>
</section>
<section title="rel">
<t>
The value of the "rel" property indicates the name of the 
relation to the target resource. The relation to the target should be interpreted as specifically from the instance object that the schema (or sub-schema) applies to, not just the top level resource that contains the object within its hierarchy. If a resource JSON representation contains a sub object with a property interpreted as a link, that sub-object holds the relation with the target. A relation to target from the top level resource must be indicated with the schema describing the top level JSON representation.
</t>
<t>
Relationship definitions SHOULD NOT be media type dependent, and users are encouraged to utilize existing accepted relation definitions, including those in existing relation registries (see &rfc4287). However, we define these relation here for clarity of normative interpretation within the context of JSON hyper schema defined relations:
<list>
<t>
self - If the relation value is "self", when this property is encountered in
the instance object, the object represents a resource and the instance object is
treated as a full representation of the target resource identified by
the specified URI.
</t>
<t>
full - This indicates that the target of the link is the full representation for the instance object. The object that contains this link may not be the full representation.
</t>
<t>
describedby - This indicates the target of the link is the schema for the instance object. This may be used to specifically denote the schemas of objects within a JSON object hierarchy, facilitating polymorphic type data structures.
</t>
<t>
The following relations are applicable for schemas (the schema as the "from" resource in the relation).
</t>
<t>
instances - This indicates the target resource that represents collection of instances of a schema. 
</t>
<t>
create - This indicates a target to use for creating new instances of a schema. This link definition SHOULD be a submission link with a non-safe method (like POST).
</t>
</list>
For example, if a schema is defined:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
{
    "links": [
    	{
    		"rel": "self"
    		"href": "{id}"
    	},
    	{
    		"rel": "up"
    		"href": "{upId}"
    	},
    	{
    		"rel": "children"
    		"href": "?upId={id}"
    	}
    ]
}
]]></artwork>
</figure>
And if a collection of instance resource's JSON representation was
retrieved:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
GET /Resource/

[
    {
        "id": "thing",
        "upId": "parent"
    },
    {
        "id": "thing2",
        "upId": "parent"
    }
]
]]></artwork>
</figure>

This would indicate that for the first item in the collection, it's own
(self) URI would resolve to "/Resource/thing" and the first item's "up"
relation should be resolved to the resource at "/Resource/parent".
The "children" collection would be located at "/Resource/?upId=thing".
</t>
</section>
<section title="Submission Link Properties">
<t>
The following properties also apply to link definition objects, and 
provide functionality analogous to HTML forms, in providing a 
means for submitting extra (often user supplied) information to send to a server.
</t>
<section title="method">
<t>

This indicates which method should be used to access the target resource. 
In an HTTP environment, this would be "GET" or "POST" (other HTTP methods 
such as "PUT" and "DELETE" have semantics that are clearly implied by 
accessed resources, and do not need to be defined here). 
This defaults to "GET".
</t>
</section>

<section title="enctype">
<t>
If present, this property indicates a query media type format that the server
supports for querying or posting to the collection of instances at the target 
resource. The query can be 
suffixed to the target URI to query the collection with
property-based constraints on the resources that SHOULD be returned from
the server or used to post data to the resource (depending on the method). 
For example, with the following schema:

This indicates that the client can query the server for instances that
have a specific name:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
/Product/?name=Slinky
]]></artwork>
</figure>

If no enctype or method is specified, only the single URI specified by 
the href property is defined. If the method is POST, application/json is 
the default media type.
</t>
</section>
<section title="properties">
<t>
This is inherited from the base JSON schema definition, and can follow the 
same structure, but its meaning should be used to define the acceptable 
property names and values for the action (whether it be for the GET query 
or POST body). If properties are omitted, and this form is the child of a 
schema, the properties from the parent schema should be used as the basis 
for the form action.

    <section title="fragmentResolution">
    <t>This property indicates the fragment resolution protocol to use for
resolving fragment identifiers in URIs within the instance
representations. This applies to the instance object URIs and all
children of the instance object's URIs. The default fragment resolution
protocol is "dot-delimited", which is defined below. Other fragment
resolution protocols may be used, but are not defined in this
document.

</t>
<t>
The fragment identifier is based on RFC 2396 Sec 5, and defines the
mechanism for resolving references to entities within a document.
</t>
<section title="dot-delimited fragment resolution">
<t>With the dot-delimited fragment resolution protocol, the fragment
identifier is interpreted as a series of property reference tokens that
are delimited by the "." character (\x2E). Each property reference token
is a series of any legal URI component characters except the "." character. Each property
reference token should be interpreted, starting from the beginning of
the fragment identifier, as a path reference in the target JSON
structure. The final target value of the fragment can be determined by
starting with the root of the JSON structure from the representation of
the resource identified by the pre-fragment URI. If the target is a JSON
object, than the new target is the value of the property with the name
identified by the next property reference token in the fragment. If the
target is a JSON array, than the target is determined by finding the
item in array the array with the index defined by the next property
reference token (which MUST be a number). The target is successively
updated for each property reference token, until the entire fragment has
been traversed. 
</t>
<t>
Property names SHOULD be URI-encoded. In particular, any "." in a 
property name MUST be encoded to avoid being interpreted as a property 
delimiter.
</t>
<t>
For example, for the following JSON representation:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
{
   "foo":{
      "anArray":[
        {"prop":44}
      ],
      "another prop":{
          "baz":"A string"
      }
   }
}
]]></artwork>
</figure>
The following fragment identifiers would be resolved:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
fragment identifier    resolution
-------------------    ----------
#                      self, the root of the resource itself
#foo                   the object referred to by the foo property
#foo.another prop      the object referred to by the "another prop"
                       property of the object referred to by the 
                       "foo" property
#foo.another prop.baz  the string referred to by the value of "baz"
                       property of the "another prop" property of 
                       the object referred to by the "foo" property
#foo.anArray.0         the first object in the "anArray" array
]]></artwork>

</t>
</section>


</section>

    <section title="root">
    <t>This attribute indicates that the value of the instance property value
SHOULD be treated as the root or the body of the representation for the
purposes of user agent interaction and fragment resolution (all other
properties of the instance objects are can be regarded as meta-data
descriptions for the data).

</t>

</section>
<section title="readonly">
<t>This indicates that the instance property should not be changed. Attempts by a user agent to modify the value of this property are expected to be rejected by a server.</t>
</section> 

    <section title="pathStart">
    <t>This property value is a URI-Reference that indicates the URI that all 
the URIs for the instances of the schema should start with. When 
multiple schemas have been referenced for an instance, the user agent 
can determine if this schema is applicable for a particular instance by 
determining if URI of the instance begins with the pathStart's referenced 
URI. pathStart MUST be resolved as per [RFC3986] section 5. If the URI of 
the instance does not start with URI indicated by pathStart, or if another 
schema specifies a starting URI that is longer and also matches the 
instance, this schema should not be applied to the instance. Any schema 
that does not have a pathStart attribute should be considered applicable 
to all the instances for which it is referenced.


</t>


</section>
    <section title="mediaType">
    <t>This indicates the media type of the instance representations that this schema is defining.
</t>

</section>

    <section title="alternate">
    <t>This is an array of JSON schema definitions that define any 
    other schemas for alternate JSON-based representations
    of the instance resources.
</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This specification is a sub-type of the JSON format, and 
consequently the security considerations are generally the same as RFC
4627. However, an additional issue is that when link relation of "self"
is used to denote a full representation of an object, the user agent 
SHOULD NOT consider the representation to be the authoritative representation
of the resource denoted by the target URI if the target URI is not
equivalent to or a sub-path of the the URI used to request the resource 
representation which contains the target URI with the "self" link.
For example, if a hyper schema was defined:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
{
  "links":[
  	{
  		"rel":"self",
  		"href":"{id}"
  	}
  ]
}
]]></artwork>
</figure>
And a resource was requested from somesite.com:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
GET /foo/
]]></artwork>
</figure>

With a response of:
    <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
Content-Type: application/json; describedby=/schema-for-this-data
[
  {"id":"bar", "name":"This representation can be safely treated \
        as authoritative "},
  {"id":"/baz", "name":"This representation should not be treated as \
        authoritative the user agent should make request the resource\
        from "/baz" to ensure it has the authoritative representation"},
  {"id":"http://othersite.com/something", "name":"This representation\
        should also not be treated as authoritative and the target\
        resource representation should be retrieved for the\
        authoritative representation"}
]
]]></artwork>
</figure>
</t>
</section>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
   The proposed MIME media type for JSON Schema is application/schema+json
</t>
<t>
   Type name: application
</t>
<t>
   Subtype name: schema+json
</t>
<t>
   Required parameters: describedby
   </t>
   <t>
   	The value of the describedby parameter should be a URI (relative or absolute) that 
   	refers to the schema used to define the structure of this structure (the 
   	meta-schema). Normally the value would be http://json-schema.org/hyper-schema,
   	but it is allowable to use other schemas that extend the hyper schema's meta-
   	schema.
</t>
<t>
   Optional parameters: pretty
   </t>
   <t>
   	The value of the pretty parameter may be true or false to indicate if additional
   	whitespace has been included to make the JSON representation easier to read.
</t>

<section title="Registry of Link Relations">
<t>
This registry is maintained by IANA per RFC 4287 and this specification adds
three values: "full", "create", "instances".  New
   assignments are subject to IESG Approval, as outlined in [RFC5226].
   Requests should be made by email to IANA, which will then forward the
   request to the IESG, requesting approval.
